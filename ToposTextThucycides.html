This belief was not without its grounds. The preparations of both the combatants were in every department in the last state of perfection; and he could see the rest of the Hellenic race taking sides in the quarrel; those who delayed doing so at once having it in contemplation. 2 Indeed this was the greatest movement yet known in history, not only of the Hellenes, but of a large part of the barbarian world โ I had almost said of mankind. 3 For though the events of remote antiquity, and even those that more immediately precede the war, could not from lapse of time be clearly ascertained, yet the evidences which an inquiry carried as far back as was practicable leads me to trust, all point to the conclusion that there was nothing on a great scale, either in war or in other matters.' </p>                        </div>

It also invited invasion. 5 Accordingly <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.9" lat="37.9">Attica</a>, from the poverty of its soil enjoying from a very remote period freedom from faction, never changed its inhabitants. 6 And here is no inconsiderable exemplification of my assertion, that the migrations were the cause of there being no correspondent growth in other parts. The most powerful victims of war or faction from the rest of Hellas took refuge with the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> as a safe retreat; and at an early period, becoming naturalized, swelled the already large population of the city to such a height that <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.9" lat="37.9">Attica</a> became at last too small to hold them, and they had to send out colonies to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon" class="place modal-trigger" long="27.7" lat="38">Ionia</a>. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001:1.3"><b>ยง 1.3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another circumstance that contributes not a little to my conviction of the weakness of ancient times. Before the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="26.2389" lat="39.9575">Trojan</a> war there is no indication of any common action in Hellas, 2 nor indeed of the universal prevalence of the name; on the contrary, before the time of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/1732" target="_blank">Hellen</a>, son of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/10993" target="_blank">Deucalion</a>, no such appellation existed, but the country went by the names of the different tribes, in particular of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.5" lat="39.5">Pelasgian</a>. It was not till <a href="https://topostext.org/people/1732" target="_blank">Hellen</a> and his sons grew strong in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/393223RPht" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.5" lat="39.2">Phthiotis</a>, and were invited as allies into the other cities, that one by one they gradually acquired from the connection the name of Hellenes; though a long time elapsed before that name could fasten itself upon all. 3 The best proof of this is furnished by <a href="https://topostext.org/people/9" target="_blank">Homer</a>. Born long after the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="26.2389" lat="39.9575">Trojan</a> war, he nowhere calls all of them by that name, nor indeed any of them except the followers of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/17" target="_blank">Achilles</a> from <a about="https://topostext.org/place/393223RPht" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.5" lat="39.2">Phthiotis</a>, who were the original Hellenes: in his poems they are called <a href="https://topostext.org/people/379" target="_blank">Danaans</a>, <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.7195" lat="37.6316">Argives</a>, and <a about="https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="21.9" lat="38.2">Achaeans</a>. He does not even use the term barbarian, probably because the Hellenes had not yet been marked off from the rest of the world by one distinctive appellation. 4 It appears therefore that the several Hellenic communities, comprising not only those who first acquired the name, city by city, as they came to understand each other, but also those who assumed it afterwards as the name of the whole people, were before the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="26.2389" lat="39.9575">Trojan</a> war prevented by their want of strength and the absence of mutual intercourse from displaying any collective action. Indeed, they could not unite for this expedition till they had gained increased familiarity with the sea. </p>                        </div>

They would fall upon a town unprotected by walls, and consisting of a mere collection of villages, and would plunder it; indeed, this came to be the main source of their livelihood, no disgrace being yet attached to such an achievement, but even some glory. 2 An illustration of this is furnished by the honor with which some of the inhabitants of the continent still regard a successful marauder, and by the question we find the old poets everywhere representing the people as asking of voyagers โ 'Are they <a href="https://topostext.org/people/10975" target="_blank">pirates</a>?' โ as if those who are asked the question would have no idea of disclaiming the imputation, or their interrogators of reproaching them for it. 3 The same rapine prevailed also by land. And even at the present day many parts of Hellas still follow the old fashion, the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/384222ROzo" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.2" lat="38.4">Ozolian Locrians</a>, for instance, the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="21.5" lat="38.6">Aetolians</a>, the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/388210RAka" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="21" lat="38.8">Acarnanians</a>, and that region of the continent; and the custom of carrying arms is still kept up among these continentals, from the old piratical habits. </p>                        </div>

To this day among some of the barbarians, especially in Asia, when prizes for boxing and wrestling are offered, belts are worn by the combatants. 6 And there are many other points in which a likeness might be shown between the life of the Hellenic world of old and the barbarian of today. </p>                        </div>

First of all <a href="https://topostext.org/people/170" target="_blank">Pelops</a>, arriving among a needy population from Asia with vast wealth, acquired such power that, stranger though he was, the country was called after him; and this power fortune saw fit materially to increase in the hands of his descendants. <a href="https://topostext.org/people/247" target="_blank">Eurystheus</a> had been killed in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.9" lat="37.9">Attica</a> by the <a href="https://topostext.org/people/324" target="_blank">Heraclids</a>. <a href="https://topostext.org/people/126" target="_blank">Atreus</a> was his mother's brother; and to the hands of his relation, who had left his father on account of the death of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/186" target="_blank">Chrysippus</a>, <a href="https://topostext.org/people/247" target="_blank">Eurystheus</a>, when he set out on his expedition, had committed <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.7561" lat="37.7308">Mycenae</a> and the government. As time went on and <a href="https://topostext.org/people/247" target="_blank">Eurystheus</a> did not return, <a href="https://topostext.org/people/126" target="_blank">Atreus</a> complied with the wishes of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.7561" lat="37.7308">Mycenaeans</a>, who were influenced by fear of the <a href="https://topostext.org/people/324" target="_blank">Heraclids</a>, โ besides, his power seemed considerable, and he had not neglected to court the favour of the populace, โ and assumed the sceptre of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.7561" lat="37.7308">Mycenae</a> and the rest of the dominions of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/247" target="_blank">Eurystheus</a>.

He had also a navy far stronger than his contemporaries, so that, in my opinion, fear was quite as strong an element as love in the formation of the confederate expedition. 4 The strength of his navy is shown by the fact that his own was the largest contingent, and that of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.3" lat="37.5">Arcadians</a> was furnished by him; this at least is what <a href="https://topostext.org/people/9" target="_blank">Homer</a> says, if his testimony is deemed sufficient. Besides, in his account of the transmission of the sceptre, he calls him 'Of many an isle, and of all <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.7195" lat="37.6316">Argos</a> king.' Hom. Il. 2.108 Now <a href="https://topostext.org/people/47" target="_blank">Agamemnon</a>'s was a continental power; and he could not have been master of any except the adjacent islands (and these would not be many), but through the possession of a fleet.

Still, as the city is neither built in a compact form nor adorned with magnificent sanctuaries and public edifices, but composed of villages after the old fashion of Hellas, there would be an impression of inadequacy. Whereas, if <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a> were to suffer the same misfortune, I suppose that any inference from the appearance presented to the eye would make her power to have been twice as great as it is. 3 We have therefore no right to be skeptical, nor to content ourselves with an inspection of a town to the exclusion of a consideration of its power; but we may safely conclude that the armament in question surpassed all before it, as it fell short of modern efforts; if we can here also accept the testimony of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/9" target="_blank">Homer</a>'s poems, in which, without allowing for the exaggeration which a poet would feel himself licensed to employ, we can see that it was far from equalling ours. 4 He has represented it as consisting of twelve hundred vessels; the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.25" lat="38.35">Boeotian</a> complement of each ship being a hundred and twenty men, that of the ships of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/448" target="_blank">Philoctetes</a> fifty. By this, I conceive, he meant to convey the maximum and the minimum complement: at any rate he does not specify the amount of any others in his catalogue of the ships. That they were all rowers as well as warriors we see from his account of the ships of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/448" target="_blank">Philoctetes</a>, in which all the men at the oar are bowmen. Now it is improbable that many supernumeraries sailed if we except the kings and high officers; especially as they had to cross the open sea with munitions of war, in ships, moreover, that had no decks, but were equipped in the old piratical fashion. 5 So that if we strike the average of the largest and smallest ships, the number of those who sailed will appear inconsiderable, representing, as they did, the whole force of Hellas. </p>                        </div>

Assuredly they will not be disturbed either by the lays of a poet displaying the exaggeration of his craft, or by the compositions of the chroniclers that are attractive at truth's expense; the subjects they treat of being out of the reach of evidence, and time having robbed most of them of historical value by enthroning them in the region of legend. Turning from these, we can rest satisfied with having proceeded upon the clearest data, and having arrived at conclusions as exact as can be expected in matters of such antiquity. 2 To come to this war; despite the known disposition of the actors in a struggle to overrate its importance, and when it is over to return to their admiration of earlier events, yet an examination of the facts will show that it was much greater than the wars which preceded it. </p>                        </div>

The <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesian</a> war was prolonged to an immense length, and long as it was it was short without parallel for the misfortunes that it brought upon Hellas. 2 Never had so many cities been taken and laid desolate, here by the barbarians, here by the parties contending โ the old inhabitants being sometimes removed to make room for others; never was there so much banishing and blood-shedding, now on the field of battle, now in the strife of action. 3 Old stories of occurrences handed down by tradition, but scantily confirmed by experience, suddenly ceased to be incredible; there were earthquakes of unparalleled extent and violence; eclipses of the sun occurred with a frequency unrecorded in previous history; there were great droughts in sundry places and consequent famines, and that most calamitous and awfully fatal visitation, the plague. All this came upon them with the late war, 4 which was begun by the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> and <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> by the dissolution of the thirty years' truce made after the conquest of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.87" lat="38.53">Euboea</a>. 5 To the question why they broke the treaty, I answer by placing first an account of their grounds of complaint and points of difference, that no one may ever have to ask the immediate cause which plunged the Hellenes into a war of such magnitude. 6 The real cause I consider to be the one which was formally most kept out of sight. The growth of the power of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>, and the alarm which this inspired in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemon</a>, made war inevitable.

But if they cannot clearly establish any of these points, they must not be annoyed if they meet with a rebuff. 2 Now the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="19.9156" lat="39.6063">Corcyraeans</a> believe that with their petition for assistance they can also give you a satisfactory answer on these points, and they have therefore despatched us hither. 3 It has so happened that our policy as regards you, with respect to this request, turns out to be inconsistent, and as regards our interests, to be at the present crisis inexpedient. 4 We say inconsistent, because a power which has never in the whole of her past history been willing to ally herself with any of her neighbors, is now found asking them to ally themselves with her. And we say inexpedient, because in our present war with <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.8802" lat="37.9054">Corinth</a> it has left us in a position of entire isolation, and what once seemed the wise precaution of refusing to involve ourselves in alliances with other powers, lest we should also involve ourselves in risks of their choosing, has now proved to be folly and weakness. 5 It is true that in the late naval engagement we drove back the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.8802" lat="37.9054">Corinthians</a> from our shores single-handed.

First, because your assistance will be rendered to a power which, herself inoffensive, is a victim to the injustice of others. Secondly, because all that we most value is at stake in the present contest, and your welcome of us under these circumstances will be a proof of good will which will ever keep alive the gratitude you will lay up in our hearts. Thirdly, yourselves excepted, we are the greatest naval power in Hellas. 2 Moreover, can you conceive a stroke of good fortune more rare in itself, or more disheartening to your enemies, than that the power whose adhesion you would have valued above much material and moral strength, should present herself self-invited, should deliver herself into your hands without danger and without expense, and should lastly put you in the way of gaining a high character in the eyes of the world, the gratitude of those whom you shall assist, and a great accession of strength for yourselves? You may search all history without finding many instances of a people gaining all these advantages at once, or many instances of a power that comes in quest of assistance being in a position to give to the people whose alliance she solicits as much safety and honor as she will receive. 3 But it will be urged that it is only in the case of a war that we shall be found useful. To this we answer that if any of you imagine that the war is far off, he is grievously mistaken, and is blind to the fact that <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemon</a> regards you with jealousy and desires war, and that <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.8802" lat="37.9054">Corinth</a> is powerful there, โ the same, remember, that is your enemy, and is even now trying to subdue us as a preliminary to attacking you.

This ought not to be, but you should either forbid her enlisting men in your dominions, or you should lend us too what help you may think advisable. 5 But your real policy is to afford us avowed countenance and support. The advantages of this course, as we premised in the beginning of our speech, are many. We mention one that is perhaps the chief. Could there be a clearer guarantee of our good faith than is offered by the fact that the power which is at enmity with you, is also at enmity with us, and that that power is fully able to punish defection. And there is a wide difference between declining the alliance of an inland and of a maritime power. For your first endeavor should be to prevent, if possible, the existence of any naval power except your own; failing this, to secure the friendship of the strongest that does exist. </p>                        </div>

They also talk of our being guilty of injustice, and their being the victims of an unjustifiable war. It becomes necessary for us to touch upon both these points before we proceed to the rest of what we have to say, that you may have a more correct idea of the grounds of our claim, and have good cause to reject their petition. 2 According to them, their old policy of refusing all offers of alliance was a policy of moderation. It was in fact adopted for bad ends, not for good; indeed their conduct is such as to make them by no means desirous of having allies present to witness it, or of having the shame of asking their concurrence. 3 Besides, their geographical situation makes them independent of others, and consequently the decision in cases where they injure any lies not with judges appointed by mutual agreement, but with themselves, because while they seldom make voyages to their neighbors, they are constantly being visited by foreign vessels which are compelled to put in to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer" class="place modal-trigger" long="19.9156" lat="39.6063">Corcyra</a>. 4 In short, the object that they propose to themselves in their specious policy of complete isolation, is not to avoid sharing in the crimes of others, but to secure a monopoly of crime to themselves, โ the license of outrage wherever they can compel, of fraud wherever they can elude, and the enjoyment of their gains without shame. 5 And yet if they were the honest men they pretend to be, the less hold that others had upon them, the stronger would be the light in which they might have put their honesty by giving and taking what was just. </p>                        </div>

And not satisfied with their own misconduct there, they appear here now requiring you to join with them not in alliance, but in crime, and to receive them in spite of their being at enmity with us. 3 But it was when they stood firmest, that they should have made overtures to you, and not at a time when we have been wronged, and they are in peril; nor yet at a time when you will be admitting to a share in your protection those who never admitted you to a share in their power, and will be incurring an equal amount of blame from us with those in whose offences you had no hand.

But that you cannot equitably receive them, this you have still to learn. 2 It may be true that one of the provisions of the treaty is that it shall be competent for any state, whose name was not down on the list, to join whichever side it pleases. But this agreement is not meant for those whose object in joining is the injury of other powers, but for those whose need of support does not arise from the fact of defection, and whose adhesion will not bring to the power that is mad enough to receive them war instead of peace; which will be the case with you, if you refuse to listen to us. 3 For you cannot become their auxiliary and remain our friend; if you join in their attack, you must share the punishment which the defenders inflict on them. 4 And yet you have the best possible right to be neutral, or failing this, you should on the contrary join us against them. <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.8802" lat="37.9054">Corinth</a> is at least in treaty with you; with <a about="https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer" class="place modal-trigger" long="19.9156" lat="39.6063">Corcyra</a> you were never even in truce.

We are at last assembled. 2 It has not been easy to assemble, nor even now are our objects defined. We ought not to be still inquiring into the fact of our wrongs, but into the means of our defence.

The deficiency created by the miscarriage of an undertaking is soon filled up by fresh hopes; for they alone are enabled to call a thing hoped for a thing got, by the speed with which they act upon their resolutions. 8 Thus they toil on in trouble and danger all the days of their life, with little opportunity for enjoying, being ever engaged in getting: their only idea of a holiday is to do what the occasion demands, and to them laborious occupation is less of a misfortune than the peace of a quiet life. 9 To describe their character in a word, one might truly say that they were born into the world to take no rest themselves and to give none to others. </p>                        </div>

It is not to combat the accusations of the cities โ indeed you are not the judges before whom either we or they can plead โ but to prevent your taking the wrong course on matters of great importance by yielding too readily to the persuasions of your allies. We also wish to show on a review of the whole indictment that we have a fair title to our possessions, and that our country has claims to consideration. 2 We need not refer to remote antiquity: there we could appeal to the voice of tradition, but not to the experience of our audience. But to the <a href="https://topostext.org/people/538" target="_blank">Median</a> war and contemporary history we must refer, although we are rather tired of continually bringing this subject forward. In our action during that war we ran great risk to obtain certain advantages: you had your share in the solid results, do not try to rob us of all share in the good that the glory may do us. 3 However, the story shall be told not so much to deprecate hostility as to testify against it, and to show, if you are so ill-advised as to enter into a struggle with <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>, what sort of an antagonist she is likely to prove. 4 We assert that at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB" class="place modal-trigger" long="24.0002" lat="38.144">Marathon</a> we were at the front, and faced the barbarian single-handed. That when he came the second time, unable to cope with him by land we went on board our ships with all our people, and joined in the action at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380236ASSB" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.573" lat="37.952">Salamis</a>. This prevented his taking the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesian</a> states in detail, and ravaging them with his fleet; when the multitude of his vessels would have made any combination for self-defence impossible. 5 The best proof of this was furnished by the invader himself.

Well, to this result we contributed three very useful elements, viz. the largest number of ships, the ablest commander, and the most unhesitating patriotism. Our contingent of ships was little less than two-thirds of the whole four hundred; the commander was <a href="https://topostext.org/people/77" target="_blank">Themistocles</a>, through whom chiefly it was that the battle took place in the straits, the acknowledged salvation of our cause. Indeed, this was the reason of your receiving him with honors such as had never been accorded to any foreign visitor. 2 While for daring patriotism we had no competitors. Receiving no reinforcements from behind, seeing everything in front of us already subjugated, we had the spirit, after abandoning our city, after sacrificing our property โ instead of deserting the remainder of the league or depriving them of our services by dispersing โ to throw ourselves into our ships and meet the danger, without a thought of resenting your neglect to assist us. 3 We assert, therefore, that we conferred on you quite as much as we received. For you had a stake to fight for; the cities which you had left were still filled with your homes, and you had the prospect of enjoying them again; and your coming was prompted quite as much by fear for yourselves as for us; at all events, you never appeared till we had nothing left to lose. But we left behind us a city that was a city no longer, and staked our lives for a city that had an existence only in desperate hope, and so bore our full share in your deliverance and in ours. 4 But if we had copied others, and allowed fears for our territory to make us give in our adhesion to the Mede before you came, or if we had suffered our ruin to break our spirit and prevent us embarking in our ships, your naval inferiority would have made a sea-fight unnecessary, and his objects would have been peaceably attained. </p>                        </div>

And it was not we who set the example, for it has always been the law that the weaker should be subject to the stronger.

If we had done so, not even would they have disputed that the weaker must give way to the stronger. 4 Men's indignation, it seems, is more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong; the first looks like being cheated by an equal, the second like being compelled by a superior. 5 At all events they contrived to put up with much worse treatment than this from the Mede, yet they think our rule severe, and this is to be expected, for the present always weighs heavy on the conquered.

We are warlike, because self-control contains honor as a chief constituent, and honor bravery. And we are wise, because we are educated with too little learning to despise the laws, and with too severe a self-control to disobey them, and are brought up not to be too knowing in useless matters, โ such as the knowledge which can give a specious criticism of an enemy's plans in theory, but fails to assail them with equal success in practice, โ but are taught to consider that the schemes of our enemies are not dissimilar to our own, and that the freaks of chance are not determinable by calculation. 4 In practice we always base our preparations against an enemy on the assumption that his plans are good; indeed, it is right to rest our hopes not on a belief in his blunders, but on the soundness of our provisions.

For the bounds of the city were extended at every point of the circumference; and so they laid hands on everything without exception in their haste. 3 <a href="https://topostext.org/people/77" target="_blank">Themistocles</a> also persuaded them to finish the walls of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a>, which had been begun before, in his year of office as archon; being influenced alike by the fineness of a locality that has three natural harbors, and by the great start which the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> would gain in the acquisition of power by becoming a naval people. 4 For he first ventured to tell them to stick to the sea and forthwith began to lay the foundations of the empire. 5 It was by his advice, too, that they built the walls of that thickness which can still be discerned round <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a>, the stones being brought up by two wagons meeting each other. Between the walls thus formed there was neither rubble nor mortar, but great stones hewn square and fitted together, cramped to each other on the outside with iron and lead. About half the height that he intended was finished. 6 His idea was by their size and thickness to keep off the attacks of an enemy; he thought that they might be adequately defended by a small garrison of invalids, and the rest be freed for service in the fleet. 7 For the fleet claimed most of his attention. He saw, as I think, that the approach by sea was easier for the king's army than that by land: he also thought <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a> more valuable than the upper city; indeed, he was always advising the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a>, if a day should come when they were hard pressed by land, to go down into <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a>, and defy the world with their fleet. 8 Thus, therefore, the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> completed their wall, and commenced their other buildings immediately after the retreat of the Mede. </p>                        </div>

They then felt that they could endure it no longer, but that the time had come for them to throw themselves heart and soul upon the hostile power, and break it, if they could, by commencing the present war. 3 And though the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemonians</a> had made up their own minds on the fact of the breach of the treaty and the guilt of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a>, yet they sent to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.50108" lat="38.48264">Delphi</a> and inquired of the god whether it would be well with them if they went to war; and, as it is reported, received from him the answer that if they put their whole strength into the war, victory would be theirs, and the promise that he himself would be with them, whether invoked or uninvoked. </p>                        </div>

We say their duty, for supremacy has its duties. Besides equitably administering private interests, leaders are required to show a special care for the common welfare in return for the special honors accorded to them by all in other ways. 2 For ourselves, all who have already had dealings with the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> require no warning to be on their guard against them. The states more inland and out of the highway of communication should understand that if they omit to support the coast powers, the result will be to injure the transit of their produce for exportation and the reception in exchange of their imports from the sea; and they must not be careless judges of what is now said, as if it had nothing to do with them, but must expect that the sacrifice of the powers on the coast will one day be followed by the extension of the danger to the interior, and must recognize that their own interests are deeply involved in this discussion. 3 For these reasons they should not hesitate to exchange peace for war. If wise men remain quiet, while they are not injured, brave men abandon peace for war when they are injured, returning to an understanding on a favorable opportunity: in fact, they are neither intoxicated by their success in war, nor disposed to take an injury for the sake of the delightful tranquillity of peace. 4 Indeed, to falter for the sake of such delights is, if you remain inactive, the quickest way of losing the sweets of repose to which you cling; while to conceive extravagant pretensions from success in war is to forget how hollow is the confidence by which you are elated. 5 For if many ill-conceived plans have succeeded through the still greater fatuity of an opponent, many more, apparently well laid, have on the contrary ended in disgrace. The confidence with which we form our schemes is never completely justified in their execution; speculation is carried on in safety, but, when it comes to action, fear causes failure. </p>                        </div>

For the advantages that we have by nature they cannot acquire by education; while their superiority in science must be removed by our practice. 5 The money required for these objects shall be provided by our contributions: nothing indeed could be more monstrous than the suggestion that, while their allies never tire of contributing for their own servitude, we should refuse to spend for vengeance and self-preservation the treasure which by such refusal we shall forfeit to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenian</a> rapacity, and see employed for our own ruin. </p>                        </div>

For war of all things proceeds least upon definite rules, but draws principally upon itself for contrivances to meet an emergency; and in such cases the party who faces the struggle and keeps his temper best meets with most security, and he who loses his temper about it with correspondent disaster. 2 Let us also reflect that if it was merely a number of disputes of territory between rival neighbors, it might be borne; but here we have an enemy in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>, that is a match for our whole coalition, and more than a match for any of its members; so that unless as a body and as individual nationalities and individual cities we make an unanimous stand against her, she will easily conquer us divided and in detail.

For we do not suppose that you have taken refuge in that contempt of an enemy which has proved so fatal in so many instances, โ a feeling which from the numbers that it has ruined has come to be called, not contemptuous but contemptible. </p>                        </div>

It must be known that at that time most political functions were discharged by the nine archons. 9 Meanwhile <a href="https://topostext.org/people/1661" target="_blank">Cylon</a> and his besieged companions were distressed for want of food and water. 10 Accordingly <a href="https://topostext.org/people/1661" target="_blank">Cylon</a> and his brother made their escape; but the rest being hard pressed, and some even dying of famine, seated themselves as suppliants at the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237SAA2" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72684" lat="37.97195">altar</a> in the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.7257" lat="37.9717">Acropolis</a>. 11 The <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> who were charged with the duty of keeping guard, when they saw them at the point of death in the sanctuary, raised them up on the understanding that no harm should be done to them, led them out and slew them. Some who as they passed by took refuge at the altars of the awful goddesses were despatched on the spot. From this deed the men who killed them were called accursed and guilty against the goddess, they and their descendants. 12 Accordingly these cursed ones were driven out by the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a>, driven out again by <a href="https://topostext.org/people/81" target="_blank">Cleomenes</a> of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="person modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemon</a> and an <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenian</a> faction; the living were driven out, and the bones of the dead were taken up; thus they were cast out. For all that, they came back afterwards, and their descendants are still in the city. </p>                        </div>

Admitting all this, and telling him not to be angry about the matter, <a href="https://topostext.org/people/117" target="_blank">Pausanias</a> gave him the pledge of raising him up from the sanctuary, and begged him to set off as quickly as possible, and not to hinder the business in hand. </p>                        </div>

By his own native capacity, alike unformed and unsupplemented by study, he was at once the best judge in those sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation, and the best prophet of the future, even to its most distant possibilities.

He could also excellently divine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future.

The ambassadors were Rhamphias, Melesippus, and <a href="https://topostext.org/people/8724" target="_blank">Agesander</a>.

It was resolved to deliberate once for all on all their demands, and to give them an answer. 4 There were many speakers who came forward and gave their support to one side or the other, urging the necessity of war, or the revocation of the decree and the folly of allowing it to stand in the way of peace. Among them came forward <a href="https://topostext.org/people/92" target="_blank">Pericles</a>, son of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/727" target="_blank">Xanthippus</a>, the first man of his time at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>, ablest alike in counsel and in action, and gave the following advice: - </p>                        </div>

I know that the spirit which inspires men while they are being persuaded to make war, is not always retained in action; that as circumstances change, resolutions change. Yet I see that now as before the same, almost literally the same, counsel is demanded of me; and I put it to those of you, who are allowing yourselves to be persuaded, to support the national resolves even in the case of reverses, or to forfeit all credit for their wisdom in the event of success. For sometimes the course of things is as arbitrary as the plans of man; indeed this is why we usually blame chance for whatever does not happen as we expected. 2 Now it was clear before, that <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemon</a> entertained designs against us; it is still more clear now. The treaty provides that we shall mutually submit our differences to legal settlement, and that we shall meanwhile each keep what we have. Yet the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemonians</a> never yet made us any such offer, never yet would accept from us any such offer; on the contrary, they wish complaints to be settled by war instead of by negotiation; and in the end we find them here dropping the tone of expostulation and adopting that of command. 3 They order us to raise the siege of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/402233UPot" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.3278" lat="40.1937">Potidaea</a>, to let <a about="https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.425" lat="37.75">Aegina</a> be independent, to revoke the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.34285" lat="37.997">Megara</a> decree; and they conclude with an ultimatum warning us to leave the Hellenes independent. 4 I hope that you will none of you think that we shall be going to war for a trifle if we refuse to revoke the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.34285" lat="37.997">Megara</a> decree, which appears in front of their complaints, and the revocation of which is to save us from war, or let any feeling of self-reproach linger in your minds, as if you went to war for slight cause. 5 Why, this trifle contains the whole seal and trial of your resolution. If you give way, you will instantly have to meet some greater demand, as having been frightened into obedience in the first instance; while a firm refusal will make them clearly understand that they must treat you more as equals. </p>                        </div>

For all claims from an equal, urged upon a neighbor as commands, before any attempt at legal settlement, be they great or be they small, have only one meaning, and that is slavery. 2 As to the war and the resources of either party, a detailed comparison will not show you the inferiority of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>. 3 Personally engaged in the cultivation of their land, without funds either private or public, the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> are also without experience in long wars across sea, from the strict limit which poverty imposes on their attacks upon each other. 4 Powers of this description are quite incapable of often manning a fleet or often sending out an army: they cannot afford the absence from their homes, the expenditure from their own funds; and besides, they have not command of the sea. 5 Capital, it must be remembered, maintains a war more than forced contributions. Farmers are a class of men that are always more ready to serve in person than in purse. Confident that the former will survive the dangers, they are by no means so sure that the latter will not be prematurely exhausted, especially if the war last longer than they expect, which it very likely will. 6 In a single battle the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> and their allies may be able to defy all Hellas, but they are incapacitated from carrying on a war against a power different in character from their own, by the want of the single council-chamber requisite to prompt and vigorous action, and the substitution of a diet composed of various races, in which every state possesses an equal vote, and each presses its own ends, a condition of things which generally results in no action at all. 7 The great wish of some is to avenge themselves on some particular enemy, the great wish of others to save their own pocket. Slow in assembling, they devote a very small fraction of the time to the consideration of any public object, most of it to the prosecution of their own objects. Meanwhile each fancies that no harm will come of his neglect, that it is the business of somebody else to look after this or that for him; and so, by the same notion being entertained by all separately, the common cause imperceptibly decays. </p>                        </div>

The slowness with which it comes in will cause delay; but the opportunities of war wait for no man. 2 Again, we need not be alarmed either at the possibility of their raising fortifications in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.9" lat="37.9">Attica</a>, or at their navy. 3 It would be difficult for any system of fortifications to establish a rival city, even in time of peace, much more, surely, in an enemy's country, with <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a> just as much fortified against it, as it against <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>; 4 while a mere post might be able to do some harm to the country by incursions and by the facilities which it would afford for desertion, but can never prevent our sailing into their country and raising fortifications there, and making reprisals with our powerful fleet. 5 For our naval skill is of more use to us for service on land, than their military skill for service at sea. 6 Familiarity with the sea they will not find an easy acquisition. 7 If you who have been practising at it ever since the <a href="https://topostext.org/people/538" target="_blank">Median</a> invasion have not yet brought it to perfection, is there any chance of anything considerable being effected by an agricultural, unseafaring population, who will besides be prevented from practising by the constant presence of strong squadrons of observation from <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>? 8 With a small squadron they might hazard an engagement, encouraging their ignorance by numbers; but the restraint of a strong force will prevent their moving, and through want of practice they will grow more clumsy, and consequently more timid. 9 It must be kept in mind that seamanship, just like anything else, is a matter of art, and will not admit of being taken up occasionally as an occupation for times of leisure; on the contrary, it is so exacting as to leave leisure for nothing else. </p>                        </div>

But in fact by this means we are always a match for them; and, best of all, we have a larger and higher class of native coxswains and sailors among our own citizens than all the rest of Hellas. 2 And to say nothing of the danger of such a step, none of our foreign sailors would consent to become an outlaw from his country, and to take service with them and their hopes, for the sake of a few days' high pay. 3 This, I think, is a tolerably fair account of the position of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a>; that of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a> is free from the defects that I have criticized in them, and has other advantages of its own, which they can show nothing to equal. 4 If they march against our country we will sail against theirs, and it will then be found that the desolation of the whole of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.9" lat="37.9">Attica</a> is not the same as that of even a fraction of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnese</a>; for they will not be able to supply the deficiency except by a battle, while we have plenty of land both on the islands and the continent. 5 The rule of the sea is indeed a great matter. Consider for a moment. Suppose that we were islanders: can you conceive a more impregnable position? Well, this in future should, as far as possible, be our conception of our position. Dismissing all thought of our land and houses, we must vigilantly guard the sea and the city. No irritation that we may feel for the former must provoke us to a battle with the numerical superiority of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a>. A victory would only be succeeded by another battle against the same superiority: a reverse involves the loss of our allies, the source of our strength, who will not remain quiet a day after we become unable to march against them. We must cry not over the loss of houses and land but of men's lives; since houses and land do not gain men, but men them. And if I had thought that I could persuade you, I would have bid you go out and lay them waste with your own hands, and show the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> that this at any rate will not make you submit. </p>                        </div>

It was still night, though daybreak was at hand: in daylight it was thought that their attack would be met by men full of courage and on equal terms with their assailants, while in darkness it would fall upon panic-stricken troops, who would also be at a disadvantage from their enemy's knowledge of the locality.

They were to prepare for the war, and to carry in their property from the country.

These were by no means inconsiderable, and might fairly be used. Nay, if they were ever absolutely driven to it, they might take even the gold ornaments of the Goddess herself; for the statue contained forty talents of pure gold and it was all removable. This might be used for self-preservation, and must every penny of it be restored. 6 Such was their financial position โ surely a satisfactory one. Then they had an army of thirteen thousand heavy infantry, besides sixteen thousand more in the garrisons and on home duty at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>. 7 This was at first the number of men on guard in the event of an invasion: it was composed of the oldest and youngest levies and the resident aliens who had heavy armor. The <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379237DPha" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.7062" lat="37.9373">Phaleric</a> wall ran for four miles, before it joined that round the city; and of this last nearly five had a guard, although part of it was left without one, viz. that between the Long Wall and the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379237DPha" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.7062" lat="37.9373">Phaleric</a>. Then there were the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237FLW1" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.7026" lat="37.96235">Long Walls</a> to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a>, a distance of some four miles and a half, the outer of which was manned. Lastly, the circumference of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a> with <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379237HMou" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.658" lat="37.938">Munychia</a> was nearly seven miles and a half; only half of this, however, was guarded. 8 <a href="https://topostext.org/people/92" target="_blank">Pericles</a> also showed them that they had twelve hundred <a href="https://topostext.org/people/10959" target="_blank">horse</a> including mounted archers, with sixteen hundred archers unmounted, and three hundred galleys fit for service. 9 Such were the resources of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a> in the different departments when the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesian</a> invasion was impending and hostilities were being commenced. <a href="https://topostext.org/people/92" target="_blank">Pericles</a> also urged his usual arguments for expecting a favorable issue to the war. </p>                        </div>

Except in times of danger the king at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a> was not consulted; in ordinary seasons they carried on their government and settled their affairs without his interference; sometimes even they waged war against him, as in the case of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.5415" lat="38.0441">Eleusinians</a> with <a href="https://topostext.org/people/793" target="_blank">Eumolpus</a> against <a href="https://topostext.org/people/298" target="_blank">Erechtheus</a>. 2 In <a href="https://topostext.org/people/57" target="_blank">Theseus</a>, however, they had a king of equal intelligence and power; and one of the chief features in his organization of the country was to abolish the bouleuteria and magistrates of the petty cities, and to merge them in the single <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237BBol" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.7218" lat="37.975183">Bouleuterion</a> and <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237BPry" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.7307" lat="37.9709">Prytaneion</a> of the present capital.

Indeed, from him dates the Synoecia, or Feast of Union; which is paid for by the state, and which the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> still keep in honor of the goddess. 3 Before this the city consisted of the present <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.7257" lat="37.9717">Acropolis</a> and the district beneath it looking rather towards the south. 4 The evidence: the sanctuaries of the other deities in the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.7257" lat="37.9717">Acropolis</a> itself, and those outside it are mostly founded in this quarter of the city, such as that of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237SOly" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.7337" lat="37.9694">Olympian Zeus</a>, the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237SPth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.7322" lat="37.9675">Pythion</a>, the sanctuary of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/3304" target="_blank">Earth</a>, and of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/5" target="_blank">Dionysus</a> in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237SLmn" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.73547" lat="37.96844">Limnai</a> [the marshes/lakes], for whom the older <a href="https://topostext.org/people/651" target="_blank">Dionysia</a> are to this day celebrated in the month of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/4844" target="_blank">Anthesterion</a> not only by the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> but also by their <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="27.7" lat="38">Ionian</a> descendants. 5 There are also other ancient sanctuaries in this quarter.

It was a custom of their ancestors, and the manner of it is as follows. 2 Three days before the ceremony, the bones of the dead are laid out in a tent which has been erected; and their friends bring to their relatives such offerings as they please. 3 In the funeral procession cypress coffins are borne in cars, one for each tribe; the bones of the deceased being placed in the coffin of their tribe.

For myself, I should have thought that the worth which had displayed itself in deeds, would be sufficiently rewarded by honors also shown by deeds; such as you now see in this funeral prepared at the people's cost. And I could have wished that the reputations of many brave men were not to be imperilled in the mouth of a single individual, to stand or fall according as he spoke well or ill. For it is hard to speak properly upon a subject where it is even difficult to convince your hearers that you are speaking the truth. 2 On the one hand, the friend who is familiar with every fact of the story, may think that some point has not been set forth with that fulness which he wishes and knows it to deserve; on the other, he who is a stranger to the matter may be led by envy to suspect exaggeration if he hears anything above his own nature. For men can endure to hear others praised only so long as they can severally persuade themselves of their own ability to equal the actions recounted: when this point is passed, envy comes in and with it incredulity. 3 However, since our ancestors have stamped this custom with their approval, it becomes my duty to obey the law and to try to satisfy your several wishes and opinions as best I may. </p>                        </div>

They dwelt in the country without break in the succession from generation to generation, and handed it down free to the present time by their valor. 2 And if our more remote ancestors deserve praise, much more do our own fathers, who added to their inheritance the empire which we now possess, and spared no pains to be able to leave their acquisitions to us of the present generation. 3 Lastly, there are few parts of our dominions that have not been augmented by those of us here, who are still more or less in the vigor of life; while the mother country has been furnished by us with everything that can enable her to depend on her own resources whether for war or for peace. 4 That part of our history which tells of the military achievements which gave us our several possessions, or of the ready valor with which either we or our fathers stemmed the tide of Hellenic or foreign aggression, is a theme too familiar to my hearers for me to dilate on, and I shall therefore pass it by. But what was the road by which we reached our position, what the form of government under which our greatness grew, what the national habits out of which it sprang; these are questions which I may try to solve before I proceed to my panegyric upon these men; since I think this to be a subject upon which on the present occasion a speaker may properly dwell, and to which the whole assemblage, whether citizens or foreigners, may listen with advantage. </p>                        </div>

Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if to social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. 2 The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. 3 But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace. </p>                        </div>

But the palm of courage will surely be adjudged most justly to those, who best know the difference between hardship and pleasure and yet are never tempted to shrink from danger. 4 In generosity we are equally singular, acquiring our friends by conferring not by receiving favors. Yet, of course, the doer of the favor is the firmer friend of the two, in order by continued kindness to keep the recipient in his debt; while the debtor feels less keenly from the very consciousness that the return he makes will be a payment, not a free gift. 5 And it is only the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> who, fearless of consequences, confer their benefits not from calculations of expediency, but in the confidence of liberality. </p>                        </div>

And if a test of worth be wanted, it is to be found in their closing scene, and this not only in the cases in which it set the final seal upon their merit, but also in those in which it gave the first intimation of their having any. 3 For there is justice in the claim that steadfastness in his country's battles should be as a cloak to cover a man's other imperfections; since the good action has blotted out the bad, and his merit as a citizen more than outweighed his demerits as an individual. 4 But none of these allowed either wealth with its prospect of future enjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of a day of freedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger. No, holding that vengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal blessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they joyfully determined to accept the risk, to make sure of their vengeance and to let their wishes wait; and while committing to hope the uncertainty of final success, in the business before them they thought fit to act boldly and trust in themselves. Thus choosing to die resisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from dishonor, but met danger face to face, and after one brief moment, while at the summit of their fortune, escaped, not from their fear, but from their glory. </p>                        </div>

When it fixed in the stomach, it upset it; and discharges of bile of every kind named by physicians ensued, accompanied by very great distress. 4 In most cases also an ineffectual retching followed, producing violent spasms, which in some cases ceased soon after, in others much later. 5 Externally the body was not very hot to the touch, nor pale in its appearance, but reddish, livid, and breaking out into small pustules and ulcers. But internally it burned so that the patient could not bear to have on him clothing or linen even of the very lightest description; or indeed to be otherwise than stark naked. What they would have liked best would have been to throw themselves into cold water; as indeed was done by some of the neglected sick, who plunged into the rain-tanks in their agonies of unquenchable thirst; though it made no difference whether they drank little or much. 6 Besides this, the miserable feeling of not being able to rest or sleep never ceased to torment them. The body meanwhile did not waste away so long as the distemper was at its height, but held out to a marvel against its ravages; so that when they succumbed, as in most cases, on the seventh or eighth day to the internal inflammation, they had still some strength in them. But if they passed this stage, and the disease descended further into the bowels, inducing a violent ulceration there accompanied by severe diarrhea, this brought on a weakness which was generally fatal. 7 For the disorder first settled in the head, ran its course from thence through the whole of the body, and even where it did not prove mortal, it still left its mark on the extremities; 8 for it settled in the privy parts, the fingers and the toes, and many escaped with the loss of these, some too with that of their eyes.

Meanwhile the town enjoyed an immunity from all the ordinary disorders; or if any case occurred, it ended in this. 2 Some died in neglect, others in the midst of every attention. No remedy was found that could be used as a specific; for what did good in one case, did harm in another. 3 Strong and weak constitutions proved equally incapable of resistance, all alike being swept away, although dieted with the utmost precaution. 4 By far the most terrible feature in the malady was the dejection which ensued when anyone felt himself sickening, for the despair into which they instantly fell took away their power of resistance, and left them a much easier prey to the disorder; besides which, there was the awful spectacle of men dying like <a href="https://topostext.org/people/10954" target="_blank">sheep</a>, through having caught the infection in nursing each other. This caused the greatest mortality. 5 On the one hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished from neglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a nurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the consequence. This was especially the case with such as made any pretensions to goodness: honor made them unsparing of themselves in their attendance in their friends' houses, where even the members of the family were at last worn out by the moans of the dying, and succumbed to the force of the disaster. 6 Yet it was with those who had recovered from the disease that the sick and the dying found most compassion. These knew what it was from experience, and had now no fear for themselves; for the same man was never attacked twice โ never at least fatally. And such persons not only received the congratulations of others, but themselves also, in the elation of the moment, half entertained the vain hope that they were for the future safe from any disease whatsoever. </p>                        </div>

The bodies of dying men lay one upon another, and half-dead creatures reeled about the streets and gathered round all the fountains in their longing for water. 3 The sacred places also in which they had quartered themselves were full of corpses of persons that had died there, just as they were; for as the disaster passed all bounds, men, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of everything, whether sacred or profane. 4 All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset, and they buried the bodies as best they could. Many from want of the proper appliances, through so many of their friends having died already, had recourse to the most shameless sepultures: sometimes getting the start of those who had raised a pile, they threw their own dead body upon the stranger's pyre and ignited it; sometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying on the top of another that was burning, and so went off. </p>                        </div>

Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly done in a corner, and not just as they pleased, seeing the rapid transitions produced by persons in prosperity suddenly dying and those who before had nothing succeeding to their property. 2 So they resolved to spend quickly and enjoy themselves, regarding their lives and riches as alike things of a day. 3 Perseverance in what men called honor was popular with none, it was so uncertain whether they would be spared to attain the object; but it was settled that present enjoyment, and all that contributed to it, was both honorable and useful. 4 Fear of gods or law of man there was none to restrain them. As for the first, they judged it to be just the same whether they worshipped them or not, as they saw all alike perishing; and for the last, no one expected to live to be brought to trial for his offences, but each felt that a far severer sentence had been already passed upon them all and hung ever over their heads, and before this fell it was only reasonable to enjoy life a little. </p>                        </div>

I fancy, however, that if another <a about="https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.4" lat="38.7">Dorian</a> war should ever afterwards come upon us, and a dearth should happen to accompany it, the verse will probably be read accordingly. 4 The oracle also which had been given to the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemonians</a> was now remembered by those who knew of it.

But if the only choice was between submission with loss of independence, and danger with the hope of preserving that independence, โ in such a case it is he who will not accept the risk that deserves blame, not he who will. 2 I am the same man and do not alter, it is you who change, since in fact you took my advice while unhurt, and waited for misfortune to repent of it; and the apparent error of my policy lies in the infirmity of your resolution, since the suffering that it entails is being felt by every one among you, while its advantage is still remote and obscure to all, and a great and sudden reverse having befallen you, your mind is too much depressed to persevere in your resolves. 3 For before what is sudden, unexpected, and least within calculation the spirit quails; and putting all else aside, the plague has certainly been an emergency of this kind. 4 Born, however, as you are, citizens of a great state, and brought up, as you have been, with habits equal to your birth, you should be ready to face the greatest disasters and still to keep unimpaired the lustre of your name. For the judgment of mankind is as relentless to the weakness that falls short of a recognized renown, as it is jealous of the arrogance that aspires higher than its due.

If those are not enough, I will now reveal an advantage arising from the greatness of your dominion, which I think has never yet suggested itself to you, which I never mentioned in my previous speeches, and which has so bold a sound that I should scarce adventure it now, were it not for the unnatural depression which I see around me. 2 You perhaps think that your empire extends only over your allies; I will declare to you the truth. The visible field of action has two parts, land and sea. In the whole of one of these you are completely supreme, not merely as far as you use it at present, but also to what further extent you may think fit: in fine, your naval resources are such that your vessels may go where they please, without the king or any other nation on earth being able to stop them. 3 So that although you may think it a great privation to lose the use of your land and houses, still you must see that this power is something widely different; and instead of fretting on their account, you should really regard them in the light of the gardens and other accessories that embellish a great fortune, and as, in comparison, of little moment. You should know too that liberty preserved by your efforts will easily recover for us what we have lost, while, the knee once bowed, even what you have will pass from you. Your fathers receiving these possessions not from others, but from themselves, did not let slip what their labor had acquired, but delivered them safe to you; and in this respect at least you must prove yourselves their equals, remembering that to lose what one has got is more disgraceful than to be baulked in getting, and you must confront your enemies not merely with spirit but with disdain. 4 Confidence indeed a blissful ignorance can impart, ay, even to a coward's breast, but disdain is the privilege of those who, like us, have been assured by reflection of their superiority to their adversary. 5 And where the chances are the same, knowledge fortifies courage by the contempt which is its consequence, its trust being placed, not in hope, which is the prop of the desperate, but in a judgment grounded upon existing resources, whose anticipations are more to be depended upon. </p>                        </div>

You should remember also that what you are fighting against is not merely slavery as an exchange for independence, but also loss of empire and danger from the animosities incurred in its exercise. 2 Besides, to recede is no longer possible, if indeed any of you in the alarm of the moment has become enamored of the honesty of such an unambitious part. For what you hold is, to speak somewhat plainly, a tyranny; to take it perhaps was wrong, but to let it go is unsafe. 3 And men of these retiring views, making converts of others, would quickly ruin a state; indeed the result would be the same if they could live independent by themselves; for the retiring and unambitious are never secure without vigorous protectors at their side; in fine, such qualities are useless to an imperial city, though they may help a dependency to an unmolested servitude. </p>                        </div>

It is this, I know, that has had a large share in making me more unpopular than I should otherwise have been, โ quite undeservedly, unless you are also prepared to give me the credit of any success with which chance may present you. 2 Besides, the hand of Heaven must be borne with resignation, that of the enemy with fortitude; this was the old way at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>, and do not you prevent it being so still. 3 Remember, too, that if your country has the greatest name in all the world, it is because she never bent before disaster; because she has expended more life and effort in war than any other city, and has won for herself a power greater than any hitherto known, the memory of which will descend to the latest posterity; even if now, in obedience to the general law of decay, we should ever be forced to yield, still it will be remembered that we held rule over more Hellenes than any other Hellenic state, that we sustained the greatest wars against their united or separate powers, and inhabited a city unrivalled by any other in resources or magnitude. 4 These glories may incur the censure of the slow and unambitious; but in the breast of energy they will awake emulation, and in those who must remain without them an envious regret. 5 Hatred and unpopularity at the moment have fallen to the lot of all who have aspired to rule others; but where odium must be incurred, true wisdom incurs it for the highest objects. Hatred also is shortlived; but that which makes the splendor of the present and the glory of the future remains for ever unforgotten. 6 Make your decision, therefore, for glory then and honor now, and attain both objects by instant and zealous effort: do not send heralds to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemon</a>, and do not betray any sign of being oppressed by your present sufferings, since they whose minds are least sensitive to calamity, and whose hands are most quick to meet it, are the greatest men and the greatest communities.' </p>                        </div>

When the war broke out, here also he seems to have rightly gauged the power of his country. 6 He outlived its commencement two years and six months, and the correctness of his previsions respecting it became better known by his death. 7 He told them to wait quietly, to pay attention to their marine, to attempt no new conquests, and to expose the city to no hazards during the war, and doing this, promised them a favorable result. What they did was the very contrary, allowing private ambitions and private interests, in matters apparently quite foreign to the war, to lead them into projects unjust both to themselves and to their allies โ projects whose success would only conduce to the honor and advantage of private persons, and whose failure entailed certain disaster on the country in the war. 8 The causes of this are not far to seek. <a href="https://topostext.org/people/92" target="_blank">Pericles</a> indeed, by his rank, ability, and known integrity, was enabled to exercise an independent control over the multitude โ in short, to lead them instead of being led by them; for as he never sought power by improper means, he was never compelled to flatter them, but, on the contrary, enjoyed so high an estimation that he could afford to anger them by contradiction. 9 Whenever he saw them unseasonably and insolently elated, he would with a word reduce them to alarm; on the other hand, if they fell victims to a panic, he could at once restore them to confidence. In short, what was nominally a democracy became in his hands government by the first citizen. 10 With his successors it was different. More on a level with one another, and each grasping at supremacy, they ended by committing even the conduct of state affairs to the whims of the multitude. 11 This, as might have been expected in a great and sovereign state, produced a host of blunders, and amongst them the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Sicilian</a> expedition; though this failed not so much through a miscalculation of the power of those against whom it was sent, as through a fault in the senders in not taking the best measures afterwards to assist those who had gone out, but choosing rather to occupy themselves with private cabals for the leadership of the commons, by which they not only paralyzed operations in the field, but also first introduced civil discord at home. 12 Yet after losing most of their fleet besides other forces in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="place modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Sicily</a>, and with faction already dominant in the city, they could still for three years make head against their original adversaries, joined not only by the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Sicilians</a>, but also by their own allies nearly all in revolt, and at last by the king's son, <a href="https://topostext.org/people/27" target="_blank">Cyrus</a>, who furnished the funds for the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesian</a> navy.

Besides this, the chances of war were largely against us; and perhaps also inexperience had something to do with our failure in our first naval action. 3 It was not, therefore, cowardice that produced our defeat, nor ought the determination which force has not quelled, but which still has a word to say with its adversary, to lose its edge from the result of an accident; but admitting the possibility of a chance miscarriage, we should know that brave hearts must be always brave, and while they remain so can never put forward inexperience as an excuse for misconduct. 4 Nor are you so behind the enemy in experience as you are ahead of him in courage; and although the science of your opponents would, if valor accompanied it, have also the presence of mind to carry out at an emergency the lesson it has learnt, yet a faint heart will make all art powerless in the face of danger. For fear takes away presence of mind, and without valor art is useless. 5 Against their superior experience set your superior daring, and against the fear induced by defeat the fact of your having been then unprepared; 6 remember, too, that you have always the advantage of superior numbers, and of engaging off your own coast, supported by your heavy infantry; and as a rule, numbers and equipment give victory. 7 At no point, therefore, is defeat likely; and as for our previous mistakes, the very fact of their occurrence will teach us better for the future. 8 Steersmen and sailors may, therefore, confidently attend to their several duties, none quitting the station assigned to them; 9 as for ourselves, we promise to prepare for the engagement at least as well as your previous commanders, and to give no excuse for any one misconducting himself. Should any insist on doing so, he shall meet with the punishment he deserves, while the brave shall be honored with the appropriate rewards of valor.' </p>                        </div>

Next, as to that upon which they most rely, the courage which they suppose constitutional to them, their confidence here only arises from the success which their experience in land service usually gives them, and which they fancy will do the same for them at sea. 3 But this advantage will in all justice belong to us on this element, if to them on that; as they are not superior to us in courage, but we are each of us more confident, according to our experience in our particular department. 4 Besides, as the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemonians</a> use their supremacy over the allies to promote their own glory, they are most of them being brought into danger against their will, or they would never, after such a decided defeat, have ventured upon a fresh engagement. 5 You need not, therefore, be afraid of their dash. You, on the contrary, inspire a much greater and better founded alarm, both because of your late victory and also of their belief that we should not face them unless about to do something worthy of a success so signal. 6 An adversary numerically superior, like the one before us, comes into action trusting more to strength than to resolution; while he who voluntarily confronts tremendous odds must have very great internal resources to draw upon. For these reasons the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> fear our irrational audacity more than they would ever have done a more commensurate preparation. 7 Besides, many armaments have before now succumbed to an inferior through want of skill or sometimes of courage; neither of which defects certainly are ours. 8 As to the battle, it shall not be, if I can help it, in the strait, nor will I sail in there at all; seeing that in a contest between a number of clumsily managed vessels and a small, fast, well-handled squadron, want of sea room is an undoubted disadvantage. One cannot run down an enemy properly without having a sight of him a good way off, nor can one retire at need when pressed; one can neither break the line nor return upon his rear, the proper tactics for a fast sailor; but the naval action necessarily becomes a land one, in which numbers must decide the matter. 9 For all this I will provide as far as can be. Do you stay at your posts by your ships, and be sharp at catching the word of command, the more so as we are observing one another from so short a distance; and in action think order and silence all important โ qualities useful in war generally, and in naval engagements in particular -; and behave before the enemy in a manner worthy of your past exploits. 10 The issues you will fight for are great โ to destroy the naval hopes of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> or to bring nearer to the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> their fears for the sea. 11 And I may once more remind you that you have defeated most of them already; and beaten men do not face a danger twice with the same determination.' </p>                        </div>

But for those who possessed an island with fortifications; who could fear our enemies only by sea, and there had their own force of triremes to protect them; who were independent and held in the highest honor by you โ to act as these have done, this is not revolt โ revolt implies oppression; it is deliberate and wanton aggression; an attempt to ruin us by siding with our bitterest enemies; a worse offence than a war undertaken on their own account in the acquisition of power. 3 The fate of those of their neighbors who had already rebelled and had been subdued, was no lesson to them; their own prosperity could not dissuade them from affronting danger; but blindly confident in the future, and full of hopes beyond their power though not beyond their ambition, they declared war and made their decision to prefer might to right, their attack being determined not by provocation but by the moment which seemed propitious. 4 The truth is that great good fortune coming suddenly and unexpectedly tends to make a people insolent: in most cases it is safer for mankind to have success in reason than out of reason; and it is easier for them, one may say, to stave off adversity than to preserve prosperity. 5 Our mistake has been to distinguish the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="26.5621" lat="39.1114">Mitylenians</a> as we have done: had they been long ago treated like the rest, they never would have so far forgotten themselves, human nature being as surely made arrogant by consideration, as it is awed by firmness. 6 Let them now therefore be punished as their crime requires, and do not, while you condemn the aristocracy, absolve the people. This is certain, that all attacked you without distinction, although they might have come over to us, and been now again in possession of their city. But no, they thought it safer to throw in their lot with the aristocracy and so joined their rebellion! 7 Consider therefore! if you subject to the same punishment the ally who is forced to rebel by the enemy, and him who does so by his own free choice, which of them, think you, is there that will not rebel upon the slightest pretext; when the reward of success is freedom, and the penalty of failure nothing so very terrible? 8 We meanwhile shall have to risk our money and our lives against one state after another; and if successful, shall receive a ruined town from which we can no longer draw the revenue upon which our strength depends; while if unsuccessful, we shall have an enemy the more upon our hands, and shall spend the time that might be employed in combating our existing foes in warring with our own allies. </p>                        </div>

Their offence was not involuntary, but of malice and deliberate; and mercy is only for unwilling offenders. 2 I therefore now as before persist against your reversing your first decision, or giving way to the three failings most fatal to empire โ pity, sentiment, and indulgence. 3 Compassion is due to those who can reciprocate the feeling, not to those who will never pity us in return, but are our natural and necessary foes: the orators who charm us with sentiment may find other less important arenas for their talents, in the place of one where the city pays a heavy penalty for a momentary pleasure, themselves receiving fine acknowledgments for their fine phrases; while indulgence should be shown towards those who will be our friends in future, instead of towards men who will remain just what they were, and as much our enemies as before. 4 To sum up shortly, I say that if you follow my advice you will do what is just towards the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="26.5621" lat="39.1114">Mitylenians</a>, and at the same time expedient; while by a different decision you will not oblige them so much as pass sentence upon yourselves.

Punish them as they deserve, and teach your other allies by a striking example that the penalty of rebellion is death.

I think the two things most opposed to good counsel are haste and passion; haste usually goes hand in hand with folly, passion with coarseness and narrowness of mind. 2 As for the argument that speech ought not to be the exponent of action, the man who uses it must be either senseless or interested: senseless if he believes it possible to treat of the uncertain future through any other medium; interested if wishing to carry a disgraceful measure and doubting his ability to speak well in a bad cause, he thinks to frighten opponents and hearers by well-aimed calumny. 3 What is still more intolerable is to accuse a speaker of making a display in order to be paid for it. If ignorance only were imputed, an unsuccessful speaker might retire with a reputation for honesty, if not for wisdom; while the charge of dishonesty makes him suspected, if successful, and thought, if defeated, not only a fool but a rogue. 4 The city is no gainer by such a system, since fear deprives it of its advisers; although in truth, if our speakers are to make such assertions, it would be better for the country if they could not speak at all, as we should then make fewer blunders. 5 The good citizen ought to triumph not by frightening his opponents but by beating them fairly in argument; and a wise city without over-distinguishing its best advisers, will nevertheless not deprive them of their due, and far from punishing an unlucky counsellor will not even regard him as disgraced. 6 In this way successful orators would be least tempted to sacrifice their convictions for popularity, in the hope of still higher honors, and unsuccessful speakers to resort to the same popular arts in order to win over the multitude. </p>                        </div>

It is probable that in early times the penalties for the greatest offences were less severe, and that, as these were disregarded, the penalty of death has been by degrees in most cases arrived at, which is itself disregarded in like manner. 4 Either then some means of terror more terrible than this must be discovered, or it must be owned that this restraint is useless; and that as long as poverty gives men the courage of necessity, or plenty fills them with the ambition which belongs to insolence and pride, and the other conditions of life remain each under the thraldom of some fatal and master passion, so long will the impulse never be wanting to drive men into danger. 5 Hope also and cupidity, the one leading and the other following, the one conceiving the attempt, the other suggesting the facility of succeeding, cause the widest ruin, and, although invisible agents, are far stronger than the dangers that are seen. 6 <a href="https://topostext.org/people/36" target="_blank">Fortune</a>, too, powerfully helps the delusion, and by the unexpected aid that she sometimes lends, tempts men to venture with inferior means; and this is especially the case with communities, because the stakes played for are the highest, freedom or empire, and, when all are acting together, each man irrationally magnifies his own capacity. 7 In fine, it is impossible to prevent, and only great simplicity can hope to prevent, human nature doing what it has once set its mind upon, by force of law or by any other deterrent force whatsoever. </p>                        </div>

At present, if a city that has already revolted perceive that it cannot succeed, it will come to terms while it is still able to refund expenses, and pay tribute afterwards. In the other case, what city think you would not prepare better than is now done, and hold out to the last against its besiegers, if it is all one whether it surrender late or soon? 3 And how can it be otherwise than hurtful to us to be put to the expense of a siege, because surrender is out of the question; and if we take the city, to receive a ruined town from which we can no longer draw the revenue which forms our real strength against the enemy? 4 We must not, therefore, sit as strict judges of the offenders to our own prejudice, but rather see how by moderate chastisements we may be enabled to benefit in future by the revenue-producing powers of our dependencies; and we must make up our minds to look for our protection not to legal terrors but to careful administration. 5 At present we do exactly the opposite.

Citizens like yourselves, and with more at stake than you, they opened their own walls and introduced us into their own city, not as foes but as friends, to prevent the bad among you from becoming worse; to give honest men their due; to reform principles without attacking persons, since you were not to be banished from your city, but brought home to your kindred, nor to be made enemies to any, but friends alike to all. </p>                        </div>

Their lawless act was not provoked by any action of ours; hate, not justice, inspired their decision; and even now the satisfaction which they afford us is not adequate; they will suffer by a legal sentence, not as they pretend as suppliants asking for quarter in battle, but as prisoners who have surrendered upon agreement to take their trial. 6 Vindicate, therefore, <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemonians</a>, the Hellenic law which they have broken; and to us, the victims of its violation, grant the reward merited by our zeal.

In peace there would have been neither the pretext nor the wish to make such an invitation; but in war, with an alliance always at the command of either faction for the hurt of their adversaries and their own corresponding advantage, opportunities for bringing in the foreigner were never wanting to the revolutionary parties. 2 The sufferings which revolution entailed upon the cities were many and terrible, such as have occurred and always will occur, as long as the nature of mankind remains the same; though in a severer or milder form, and varying in their symptoms, according to the variety of the particular cases. In peace and prosperity states and individuals have better sentiments, because they do not find themselves suddenly confronted with imperious necessities; but war takes away the easy supply of daily wants, and so proves a rough master, that brings most men's characters to a level with their fortunes. 3 Revolution thus ran its course from city to city, and the places which it arrived at last, from having heard what had been done before carried to a still greater excess the refinement of their inventions, as manifested in the cunning of their enterprises and the atrocity of their reprisals. 4 Words had to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them. Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability to see all sides of a question inaptness to act on any. Frantic violence, became the attribute of manliness; cautious plotting, a justifiable means of self-defence. 5 The advocate of extreme measures was always trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected. To succeed in a plot was to have a shrewd head, to divine a plot a still shrewder; but to try to provide against having to do either was to break up your party and to be afraid of your adversaries. In fine, to forestall an intending criminal, or to suggest the idea of a crime where it was wanting, was equally commended, 6 until even blood became a weaker tie than party, from the superior readiness of those united by the latter to dare everything without reserve; for such associations had not in view the blessings derivable from established institutions but were formed by ambition for their overthrow; and the confidence of their members in each other rested less on any religious sanction than upon complicity in crime. 7 The fair proposals of an adversary were met with jealous precautions by the stronger of the two, and not with a generous confidence. Revenge also was held of more account than self-preservation. Oaths of reconciliation, being only proffered on either side to meet an immediate difficulty, only held good so long as no other weapon was at hand; but when opportunity offered, he who first ventured to seize it and to take his enemy off his guard, thought this perfidious vengeance sweeter than an open one, since, considerations of safety apart, success by treachery won him the palm of superior intelligence. Indeed it is generally the case that men are readier to call rogues clever than simpletons honest, and are as ashamed of being the second as they are proud of being the first. 8 The cause of all these evils was the lust for power arising from greed and ambition; and from these passions proceeded the violence of parties once engaged in contention. The leaders in the cities, each provided with the fairest professions, on the one side with the cry of political equality of the people, on the other of a moderate aristocracy, sought prizes for themselves in those public interests which they pretended to cherish, and, recoiling from no means in their struggles for ascendancy, engaged in the direct excesses; in their acts of vengeance they went to even greater lengths, not stopping at what justice or the good of the state demanded, but making the party caprice of the moment their only standard, and invoking with equal readiness the condemnation of an unjust verdict or the authority of the strong arm to glut the animosities of the hour. Thus religion was in honor with neither party; but the use of fair phrases to arrive at guilty ends was in high reputation. Meanwhile the moderate part of the citizens perished between the two, either for not joining in the quarrel, or because envy would not suffer them to escape. </p>                        </div>

The ancient simplicity into which honor so largely entered was laughed down and disappeared; and society became divided into camps in which no man trusted his fellow. 2 To put an end to this, there was neither promise to be depended upon, nor oath that could command respect; but all parties dwelling rather in their calculation upon the hopelessness of a permanent state of things, were more intent upon self-defence than capable of confidence. 3 In this contest the blunter wits were most successful. Apprehensive of their own deficiencies and of the cleverness of their antagonists, they feared to be worsted in debate and to be surprised by the combinations of their more versatile opponents, and so at once boldly had recourse to action: 4 while their adversaries, arrogantly thinking that they should know in time, and that it was unnecessary to secure by action what policy afforded, often fell victims to their want of precaution. </p>                        </div>

At the point where its shock has been the most violent the sea is driven back, and suddenly recoiling with redoubled force, causes the inundation. Without an earthquake I do not see how such an accident could happen. </p>                        </div>

In emergencies like ours calculation is out of place; the sooner the danger is faced the better. 2 To my mind also most of the chances are for us, if we will only stand fast and not throw away our advantages, overawed by the numbers of the enemy. 3 One of the points in our favour is the awkwardness of the landing. This, however, only helps us if we stand our ground. If we give way it will be practicable enough, in spite of its natural difficulty, without a defender; and the enemy will instantly become more formidable from the difficulty he will have in retreating, supposing that we succeed in repulsing him, which we shall find it easier to do, while he is on board his ships, than after he has landed and meets us on equal terms. 4 As to his numbers, these need not too much alarm you. Large as they may be he can only engage in small detachments, from the impossibility of bringing to. Besides, the numerical superiority that we have to meet is not that of an army on land with everything else equal, but of troops on board ship, upon an element where many favorable accidents are required to act with effect. 5 I therefore consider that his difficulties may be fairly set against our numerical deficiencies, and at the same time I charge you, as <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> who know by experience what landing from ships on a hostile territory means, and how impossible it is to drive back an enemy determined enough to stand his ground and not to be frightened away by the surf and the terrors of the ships sailing in, to stand fast in the present emergency, beat back the enemy at the water's edge, and save yourselves and the place.' </p>                        </div>

It was more easy to elude the look-out of the galleys, when it blew from the seaward, as it became impossible for them to anchor round the island; while the <a href="https://topostext.org/people/12102" target="_blank">Helots</a> had their boats rated at their value in money, and ran them ashore, without caring how they landed, being sure to find the soldiers waiting for them at the landing-places. But all who risked it in fair weather were taken. 8 Divers also swam in under water from the harbour, dragging by a cord in skins poppy-seed mixed with honey, and bruised linseed; these at first escaped notice, but afterwards a look-out was kept for them. 9 In short, both sides tried every possible contrivance, the one to throw in provisions, and the other to prevent their introduction. </p>                        </div>

Such was the idea that inspired <a href="https://topostext.org/people/536" target="_blank">Demosthenes</a> in his conception of the descent, and presided over its execution. </p>                        </div>

Thus in the day that he set out from <a about="https://topostext.org/place/390225UMel" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.457" lat="39.037">Melitia</a> he performed the whole distance to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/393224UPha" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.3869" lat="39.2883">Pharsalus</a>, and encamped on the river <a about="https://topostext.org/place/393223WApi" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.104" lat="39.43">Apidanus</a>; and so to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/394223PPha" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.033" lat="39.5151">Phacium</a>, and from thence to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/398232RPer" class="place modal-trigger" long="22" lat="39.85">Perrhaebia</a>. 6 Here his <a about="https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.3" lat="39.4">Thessalian</a> escort went back, and the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/398232RPer" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22" lat="39.85">Perrhaebians</a>, who are subjects of <a about="https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.3" lat="39.4">Thessaly</a>, set him down at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/402225PDio" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.4887" lat="40.1749">Dium</a> in the dominions of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/888" target="_blank">Perdiccas</a>, a <a about="https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.5" lat="40.81">Macedonian</a> town under Mount <a about="https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.3586" lat="40.0856">Olympus</a>, looking towards <a about="https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.3" lat="39.4">Thessaly</a>. </p>                        </div>

It was to annoy <a about="https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.25" lat="38.35">Boeotia</a> that they crossed the frontier and built a fort in our country; and they are therefore, I imagine, our enemies wherever we may come up with them, and from wheresoever they may have come to act as enemies do. 2 And if any one has taken up with the idea in question for reasons of safety, it is high time for him to change his mind. The party attacked, whose own country is in danger, can scarcely discuss what is prudent with the calmness of men who are in full enjoyment of what they have got, and are thinking of attacking a neighbour in order to get more. 3 It is your national habit, in your country or out of it, to oppose the same resistance to a foreign invader; and when that invader is <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenian</a>, and lives upon your frontier besides, it is doubly imperative to do so. 4 As between neighbours generally, freedom means simply a determination to hold ones own; and with neighbours like these, who are trying to enslave near and far alike, there is nothing for it but to fight it out to the last. Look at the condition of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.87" lat="38.53">Euboeans</a> and of most of the rest of Hellas, and be convinced that others have to fight with their neighbours for this frontier or that, but that for us conquest means one frontier for the whole country, about which no dispute can be made, for they will simply come and take by force what we have. 5 So much more have we to fear from this neighbour than from another. Besides, people who, like the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> in the present instance, are tempted by pride of strength to attack their neighbours, usually march most confidently against those who keep still, and only defend themselves in their own country, but think twice before they grapple with those who meet them outside their frontier and strike the first blow if opportunity offers. 6 The <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> have shown us this themselves; the defeat which we inflicted upon them at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/384230PKor" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.9571" lat="38.3912">Coronea</a>, at the time when our quarrels had allowed them to occupy the country, has given great security to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.25" lat="38.35">Boeotia</a> until the present day. 7 Remembering this, the old must equal their ancient exploits, and the young, the sons of the heroes of that time, must endeavor not to disgrace their native valour; and trusting in the help of the god whose sanctuary has been sacrilegiously fortified, and in the victims which in our sacrifices have proved propitious, we must march against the enemy, and teach him that he must go and get what he wants by attacking some one who will not resist him, but that men whose glory it is to be always ready to give battle for the liberty of their own country, and never unjustly to enslave that of others, will not let him go without a struggle.' </p>                        </div>

As it is, in the face of the desertion of our friends and the numbers of the enemy, I have some advice and information to offer, which, brief as they must be, will, I hope, suffice for the more important points. 2 The bravery that you habitually display in war does not depend on your having allies at your side in this or that encounter, but on your native courage; nor have numbers any terrors for citizens of states like yours, in which the many do not rule the few, but rather the few the many, owing their position to nothing else than to superiority in the field. 3 Inexperience now makes you afraid of barbarians; and yet the trial of strength which you had with the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.5" lat="40.81">Macedonians</a> among them, and my own judgment, confirmed by what I hear from others, should be enough to satisfy you that they will not prove formidable. 4 Where an enemy seems strong but is really weak, a true knowledge of the facts makes his adversary the bolder, just as a serious antagonist is encountered most confidently by those who do not know him. Thus the present enemy might terrify an inexperienced imagination, they are formidable in outward bulk, their loud yelling is unbearable, and the brandishing of their weapons in the air has a threatening appearance. 5 But when it comes to real fighting with an opponent who stands his ground, they are not what they seemed; they have no regular order that they should be ashamed of deserting their positions when hard pressed; flight and attack are with them equally honourable, and afford no test of courage; their independent mode of fighting never leaving any one who wants to run away without a fair excuse for so doing. In short, they think frightening you at a secure distance a surer game than meeting you hand to hand; otherwise they would have done the one and not the other. 6 You can thus plainly see that the terrors with which they were at first invested are in fact trifling enough, though to the eye and ear very prominent. Stand your ground therefore when they advance, and again wait your opportunity to retire in good order, and you will reach a place of safety all the sooner, and will know for ever afterwards that rabble such as these, to those who sustain their first attack, do but show off their courage by threats of the terrible things that they are going to do, at a distance, but with those who give way to them are quick enough to display their heroism in pursuit when they can do so without danger.' </p>                        </div>

The things for which I am abused, bring fame to my ancestors and to myself, and to the country profit besides. 2 The Hellenes, after expecting to see our city ruined by the war, concluded it to be even greater than it really is, by reason of the magnificence with which I represented it at the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="21.63" lat="37.6378">Olympic</a> games, when I sent into the lists seven chariots, a number never before entered by any private person, and won the first prize, and was second and fourth, and took care to have everything else in a style worthy of my victory. Custom regards such displays as honourable, and they cannot be made without leaving behind them an impression of power. 3 Again, any splendour that I may have exhibited at home in providing choruses or otherwise, is naturally envied by my fellow-citizens, but in the eyes of foreigners has an air of strength as in the other instance. And this is no useless folly, when a man at his own private cost benefits not himself only, but his city: 4 nor is it unfair that he who prides himself on his position should refuse to be upon an equality with the rest. He who is badly off has his misfortunes all to himself, and as we do not see men courted in adversity, on the like principle a man ought to accept the insolence of prosperity; or else, let him first mete out equal measure to all, and then demand to have it meted out to him. 5 What I know is that persons of this kind and all others that have attained to any distinction, although they may be unpopular in their lifetime in their relations with their fellow-men and especially with their equals, leave to posterity the desire of claiming connection with them even without any ground, and are vaunted by the country to which they belonged, not as strangers or ill-doers, but as fellow-countrymen and heroes. 6 Such are my aspirations, and however I am abused for them in private, the question is whether any one manages public affairs better than I do.

Men do not rest content with parrying the attacks of a superior, but often strike the first blow to prevent the attack being made. 3 And we cannot fix the exact point at which our empire shall stop; we have reached a position in which we must not be content with retaining but must scheme to extend it, for, if we cease to rule others, we are in danger of being ruled ourselves. Nor can you look at inaction from the same point of view as others, unless you are prepared to change your habits and make them like theirs. 4 Be convinced then that we shall augment our power at home by this adventure abroad, and let us make the expedition, and so humble the pride of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> by sailing off to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="place modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Sicily</a>, and letting them see how little we care for the peace that we are now enjoying; and at the same time we shall either become masters, as we very easily may, of the whole of Hellas through the accession of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Sicilian</a> Hellenes, or in any case ruin the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="15.293" lat="37.0639">Syracusans</a>, to the no small advantage of ourselves and our allies. 5 The faculty of staying if successful, or of returning, will be secured to us by our navy, as we shall be superior at sea to all the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Siceliots</a> put together. 6 And do not let the do-nothing policy which <a href="https://topostext.org/people/115" target="_blank">Nicias</a> advocates, or his setting of the young against the old, turn you from your purpose, but in the good old fashion by which our fathers, old and young together, by their united counsels brought our affairs to their present height, do you endeavour still to advance them; understanding that neither youth nor old age can do anything the one without the other, but that levity, sobriety, and deliberate judgment are strongest when united, and that, by sinking into inaction, the city, like everything else, will wear itself out, and its skill in everything decay; while each fresh struggle will give it fresh experience, and make it more used to defend itself not in word but in deed. 7 In short, my conviction is that a city not inactive by nature could not choose a quicker way to ruin itself than by suddenly adopting such a policy, and that the safest rule of life is to take one's character and institutions for better and for worse, and to live up to them as closely as one can.' </p>                        </div>

As for the foreigners and the rest of the crowd, they simply went to see a sight worth looking at and passing all belief. Indeed this armament that first sailed out was by far the most costly and splendid Hellenic force that had ever been sent out by a single city up to that time. 2 In mere number of ships and heavy infantry that against <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376232PEpi" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.1602" lat="37.6335">Epidaurus</a> under <a href="https://topostext.org/people/92" target="_blank">Pericles</a>, and the same when going against <a about="https://topostext.org/place/402233UPot" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.3278" lat="40.1937">Potidaea</a> under <a href="https://topostext.org/people/1399" target="_blank">Hagnon</a>, was not inferior; containing as it did four thousand <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenian</a> heavy infantry, three hundred <a href="https://topostext.org/people/10959" target="_blank">horse</a>, and one hundred galleys accompanied by fifty <a about="https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="26.2" lat="39.2075">Lesbian</a> and <a about="https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="26.1342" lat="38.3764">Chian</a> vessels and many allies besides. 3 But these were sent upon a short voyage and with a scanty equipment. The present expedition was formed in contemplation of a long term of service by land and sea alike, and was furnished with ships and troops so as to be ready for either as required. The fleet had been elaborately equipped at great cost to the captains and the state; the treasury giving a drachma a day to each seaman, and providing empty ships, sixty men of war and forty transports, and manning these with the best crews obtainable; while the captains gave a bounty in addition to the pay from the treasury to the thranitae and crews generally, besides spending lavishly upon figure-heads and equipments, and one and all making the utmost exertions to enable their own ships to excel in beauty and fast sailing. Meanwhile the land forces had been picked from the best muster-rolls, and vied with each other in paying great attention to their arms and personal accoutrements. 4 From this resulted not only a rivalry among themselves in their different departments, but an idea among the rest of the Hellenes that it was more a display of power and resources than an armament against an enemy. 5 For if any one had counted up the public expenditure of the state, and the private outlay of individuals โ that is to say, the sums which the state had already spent upon the expedition and was sending out in the hands of the generals, and those which individuals had expended upon their personal outfit, or as captains of galleys had laid out and were still to lay out upon their vessels; and if he had added to this the journey money which each was likely to have provided himself with, independently of the pay from the treasury, for a voyage of such length, and what the soldiers or traders took with them for the purpose of exchange โ it would have been found that many talents in all were being taken out of the city. 6 Indeed the expedition became not less famous for its wonderful boldness and for the splendour of its appearance, than for its overwhelming strength as compared with the peoples against whom it was directed, and for the fact that this was the longest passage from home hitherto attempted, and the most ambitious in its objects considering the resources of those who undertook it. </p>                        </div>

They will not be able to do us more hurt than we shall do them; nor is the greatness of their armament altogether without advantage to us. Indeed, the greater it is the better, with regard to the rest of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Siceliots</a>, whom dismay will make more ready to join us; and if we defeat or drive them away, disappointed of the objects of their ambition โ for I do not fear for a moment that they will get what they want โ it will be a most glorious exploit for us, and in my judgment by no means an unlikely one. 5 Few indeed have been the large armaments, either Hellenic or barbarian, that have gone far from home and been successful. They cannot be more numerous than the people of the country and their neighbours, all of whom fear leagues together; and if they miscarry for want of supplies in a foreign land, to those against whom their plans were laid none the less they leave renown, although they may themselves have been the main cause of their own discomfort. 6 Thus these very <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> rose by the defeat of the Mede, in a great measure due to accidental causes, from the mere fact that <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a> had been the object of his attack; and this may very well be the case with us also. </p>                        </div>

If we <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Siceliots</a>, all together, or at least as many as possible besides ourselves, would only launch the whole of our actual navy with two months' provisions, and meet the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar" class="place modal-trigger" long="17.228" lat="40.476">Tarentum</a> and the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/398183LIap" class="place modal-trigger" long="18.3455" lat="39.791">Iapygian promontory</a>, and show them that before fighting for <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="place modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Sicily</a> they must first fight for their passage across the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon" class="place modal-trigger" long="18.7" lat="39.2">Ionian Sea</a>, we should strike dismay into their army, and set them on thinking that we have a base for our defensive โ for <a about="https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar" class="place modal-trigger" long="17.228" lat="40.476">Tarentum</a> is ready to receive us โ while they have a wide sea to cross with all their armament, which could with difficulty keep its order through so long a voyage, and would be easy for us to attack as it came on slowly and in small detachments. 5 On the other hand, if they were to lighten their vessels, and draw together their fast sailors and with these attack us, we could either fall upon them when they were wearied with rowing, or if we did not choose to do so, we could retire to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar" class="place modal-trigger" long="17.228" lat="40.476">Tarentum</a>; while they, having crossed with few provisions just to give battle, would be hard put to it in desolate places, and would either have to remain and be blockaded, or to try to sail along the coast, abandoning the rest of their armament, and being further discouraged by not knowing for certain whether the cities would receive them. 6 In my opinion this consideration alone would be sufficient to deter them from putting out from <a about="https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer" class="place modal-trigger" long="19.9156" lat="39.6063">Corcyra</a>; and what with deliberating and reconnoitring our numbers and whereabouts, they would let the season go on until winter was upon them, or, confounded by so unexpected a circumstance, would break up the expedition, especially as their most experienced general has, as I hear, taken the command against his will, and would grasp at the first excuse offered by any serious demonstration of ours. 7 We should also be reported, I am certain, as more numerous than we really are, and men's minds are affected by what they hear, and besides the first to attack, or to show that they mean to defend themselves against an attack, inspire greater fear because men see that they are ready for the emergency. 8 This would just be the case with the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> at present. They are now attacking us in the belief that we shall not resist, having a right to judge us severely because we did not help the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemonians</a> in crushing them; but if they were to see us showing a courage for which they are not prepared, they would be more dismayed by the surprise than they could ever be by our actual power. 9 I could wish to persuade you to show this courage; but if this cannot be, at all events lose not a moment in preparing generally for the war; and remember all of you that contempt for an assailant is best shown by bravery in action, but that for the present the best course is to accept the preparations which fear inspires as giving the surest promise of safety, and to act as if the danger was real.

In short, this is what these reports are worth; they do not arise of themselves, but are concocted by men who are always causing agitation here in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="place modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Sicily</a>. 3 However, if you are well advised, you will not be guided in your calculation of probabilities by what these persons tell you, but by what shrewd men and of large experience, as I esteem the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> to be, would be likely to do. 4 Now it is not likely that they would leave the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> behind them, and before they have well ended the war in Hellas wantonly come in quest of a new war quite as arduous, in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="place modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Sicily</a>; indeed, in my judgment, they are only too glad that we do not go and attack them, being so many and so great cities as we are. </p>                        </div>

And I cannot help fearing that trying so often they may one day succeed, and that we, as long as we do not feel the smart, may prove too weak for the task of prevention, or, when the offenders are known, of pursuit. 3 The result is that our city is rarely at rest, but is subject to constant troubles and to contests as frequent against herself as against the enemy, not to speak of occasional tyrannies and infamous cabals. 4 However, I will try, if you will support me, to let nothing of this happen in our time, by gaining you, the many, and by chastising the authors of such machinations, not merely when they are caught in the act โ a difficult feat to accomplish โ but also for what they have the wish though not the power to do; as is necessary to punish an enemy not only for what he does, but also beforehand for what he intends to do, if the first to relax precaution would not be also the first to suffer. I shall also reprove, watch, and on occasion warn the few โ the most effectual way, in my opinion, of turning them from their evil courses. 5 And after all, as I have often asked โ What would you have, young men? Would you hold office at once? The law forbids it, a law enacted rather because you are not competent than to disgrace you when competent.

Indeed, both these qualities would improve, since danger would exercise them in discipline, while their courage would be led to surpass itself by the confidence which skill inspires. 5 The generals should be few and elected with full powers, and an oath should be taken to leave them entire discretion in their command: if they adopted this plan, their secrets would be better kept, all preparations would be properly made, and there would be no room for excuses. </p>                        </div>

Those again who judged me unfavourably, because I leaned rather to the side of the commons, must not think that their dislike is any better founded. 4 We have always been hostile to tyrants, and all who oppose arbitrary power are called commons; hence we continued to act as leaders of the multitude; besides which, as democracy was the government of the city, it was necessary in most things to conform to established conditions. 5 However, we endeavoured to be more moderate than the licentious temper of the times; and while there were others, formerly as now, who tried to lead the multitude astray, the same who banished me, 6 our party was that of the whole people, our creed being to do our part in preserving the form of government under which the city enjoyed the utmost greatness and freedom, and which we had found existing. As for democracy, the men of sense among us knew what it was, and I perhaps as well as any, as I have the more cause to complain of it; but there is nothing new to be said of a patent absurdity โ meanwhile we did not think it safe to alter it under the pressure of your hostility. </p>                        </div>

Indeed I do not consider that I am now attacking a country that is still mine; I am rather trying to recover one that is mine no longer; and the true lover of his country is not he who consents to lose it unjustly rather than attack it, but he who longs for it so much that he will go all lengths to recover it. 5 For myself, therefore, <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemonians</a>, I beg you to use me without scruple for danger and trouble of every kind, and to remember the argument in every one's mouth, that if I did you great harm as an enemy, I could likewise do you good service as a friend, inasmuch as I know the plans of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a>, while I only guessed yours.

In our first battle with him we were victorious; in the battle on the following day we were overpowered by a multitude of cavalry and darters, and compelled to retire within our lines. 3 We have now, therefore, been forced by the numbers of those opposed to us to discontinue the work of circumvallation, and to remain inactive; being unable to make use even of all the force we have, since a large portion of our heavy infantry is absorbed in the defence of our lines. Meanwhile the enemy have carried a single wall past our lines, thus making it impossible for us to invest them in future, until this cross wall be attacked by a strong force and captured. 4 So that the besieger in name has become, at least from the land side, the besieged in reality; as we are prevented by their cavalry from even going for any distance into the country. </p>                        </div>

They have discovered that the length of the time we have now been in commission has rotted our ships and wasted our crews, and that with the entireness of our crews and the soundness of our ships the pristine efficiency of our navy has departed. 4 For it is impossible for us to haul our ships ashore and careen them, because, the enemy's vessels being as many or more than our own, we are constantly anticipating an attack. 5 Indeed, they may be seen exercising, and it lies with them to take the initiative; and not having to maintain a blockade, they have greater facilities for drying their ships. </p>                        </div>

By day certainly the combatants have a clearer notion, though even then by no means of all that takes place, no one knowing much of anything that does not go on in his own immediate neighborhood; but in a night engagement โ and this was the only one that occurred between great armies during the war? how could any one know anything for certain? 2 Although there was a bright moon they saw each other only as men do by moonlight, that is to say, they could distinguish the form of the body, but could not tell for certain whether it was a friend or an enemy. Both had great numbers of heavy infantry moving about in a small space. 3 Some of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> were already defeated, while others were coming up yet unconquered for their first attack. A large part also of the rest of their forces either had only just got up, or were still ascending, so that they did not know which way to march. Owing to the rout that had taken place all in front was now in confusion, and the noise made it difficult to distinguish anything. 4 The victorious <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="15.293" lat="37.0639">Syracusans</a> and allies were cheering each other on with loud cries, by night the only possible means of communication, and meanwhile receiving all who came against them; while the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> were seeking for one another, taking all in front of them for enemies, even although they might be some of their now flying friends; and by constantly asking for the watchword, which was their only means of recognition, not only caused great confusion among themselves by asking all at once, but also made it known to the enemy, 5 whose own they did not so readily discover, as the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="15.293" lat="37.0639">Syracusans</a> were victorious and not scattered, and thus less easily mistaken. The result was that if the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> fell in with a party of the enemy that was weaker than they, it escaped them through knowing their watchword; while if they themselves failed to answer they were put to the sword. 6 But what hurt them as much, or indeed more than anything else, was the singing of the Paean, from the perplexity which it caused by being nearly the same on either side: the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.7195" lat="37.6316">Argives</a> and <a about="https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="19.9156" lat="39.6063">Corcyraeans</a> and any other <a about="https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.4" lat="38.7">Dorian</a> peoples in the army, struck terror into the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> whenever they raised their Paean, no less than did the enemy. 7 Thus, after being once thrown into disorder, they ended by coming into collision with each other in many parts of the field, friends with friends, and citizens with citizens, and not only terrified one another, but even came to blows and could only be parted with difficulty. 8 In the pursuit many perished by throwing themselves down the cliffs, the way down from <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371152FEpi" class="place modal-trigger" long="15.222" lat="37.0912">Epipolae</a> being narrow; and of those who got down safely into the plain, although many, especially those who belonged to the first armament, escaped through their better acquaintance with the locality, some of the newcomers lost their way and wandered over the country, and were cut off in the morning by the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="15.293" lat="37.0639">Syracusan</a> cavalry and killed. </p>                        </div>

Besides this, there was a party in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr" class="place modal-trigger" long="15.293" lat="37.0639">Syracuse</a> who wished to betray the city to the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a>, and kept sending him messages and telling him not to raise the siege. 3 Accordingly, knowing this and really waiting because he hesitated between the two courses and wished to see his way more clearly, in his public speech on this occasion he refused to lead off the army, saying he was sure the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> would never approve of their returning without a vote of theirs. Those who would vote upon their conduct, instead of judging the facts as eye-witnesses like themselves and not from what they might hear from hostile critics, would simply be guided by the calumnies of the first clever speaker; 4 while many, indeed most, of the soldiers on the spot, who now so loudly proclaimed the danger of their position, when they reached <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a> would proclaim just as loudly the opposite, and would say that their generals had been bribed to betray them and return.

What with paying mercenaries, spending upon fortified posts, and now for a full year maintaining a large navy, they were already at a loss and would soon be at a standstill: they had already spent two thousand talents and incurred heavy debts besides, and could not lose even ever so small a fraction of their present force through not paying it, without ruin to their cause; depending as they did more upon mercenaries than upon soldiers obliged to serve, like their own. 6 He therefore said that they ought to stay and carry on the siege, and not depart defeated in point of money, in which they were much superior. </p>                        </div>

The original estimate of ourselves which gave us courage in the days of our unskillfulness has been strengthened, while the convictions super-added to it that we must be the best seamen of the time, if we have conquered the best, has given a double measure of hope to every man among us; and, for the most part, where there is the greatest hope, there is also the greatest ardor for action. 2 The means to combat us which they have tried to find in copying our armament are familiar to our warfare, and will be met by proper provisions; while they will never be able to have a number of heavy infantry on their decks, contrary to their custom, and a number of darters โ born landsmen, one may say, <a about="https://topostext.org/place/388210RAka" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="21" lat="38.8">Acarnanians</a> and others, embarked afloat, who will not know how to discharge their weapons when they have to keep still โ without hampering their vessels and falling all into confusion among themselves through fighting not according to their own tactics. 3 For they will gain nothing by the number of their ships โ I say this to those of you who may be alarmed by having to fight against odds โ as a quantity of ships in a confined space will only be slower in executing the movements required, and most exposed to injury from our means of offence. 4 Indeed, if you would know the plain truth, as we are credibly informed, the excess of their sufferings and the necessities of their present distress have made them desperate; they have no confidence in their force, but wish to try their fortune in the only way they can, and either to force their passage and sail out, or after this to retreat by land, it being impossible for them to be worse off than they are. </p>                        </div>

The <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="15.293" lat="37.0639">Syracusan</a> fleet was commanded by <a href="https://topostext.org/people/3249" target="_blank">Sicanus</a> and <a href="https://topostext.org/people/2031" target="_blank">Agatharchus</a>, who had each a wing of the whole force, with <a href="https://topostext.org/people/6866" target="_blank">Pythen</a> and the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.8802" lat="37.9054">Corinthians</a> in the center. 2 When the rest of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> came up to the barrier, with the first shock of their charge they overpowered the ships stationed there, and tried to undo the fastenings; after this, as the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="15.293" lat="37.0639">Syracusans</a> and allies bore down upon them from all quarters, the action spread from the barrier over the whole harbor, and was more obstinately disputed than any of the preceding ones. 3 On either side the rowers showed great zeal in bringing up their vessels at the boatswains' orders, and the helmsmen great skill in maneuvering, and great emulation one with another; while the ships once alongside, the soldiers on board did their best not to let the service on deck be outdone by the others; 4 in short, every man strove to prove himself the first in his particular department. And as many ships were engaged in a small compass โ for these were the largest fleets fighting in the narrowest space ever known, being together little short of two hundred โ the regular attacks with the beak were few, there being no opportunity of backing water or of breaking the line; while the collisions caused by one ship chancing to run foul of another, either in flying from or attacking a third, were more frequent. 5 So long as a vessel was coming up to the charge the men on the decks rained darts and arrows and stones upon her; but once alongside, the heavy infantry tried to board each other's vessel, fighting hand to hand. 6 In many quarters also it happened, by reason of the narrow room, that a vessel was charging an enemy on one side and being charged herself on another, and that two, or sometimes more ships had perforce got entangled round one, obliging the helmsmen to attend to defence here, offence there, not to one thing at once, but to many on all sides; while the huge din caused by the number of ships crashing together not only spread terror, but made the orders of the boatswains inaudible. 7 The boatswains on either side in the discharge of their duty and in the heat of the conflict shouted incessantly orders and appeals to their men; the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> they urged to force the passage out, and now if ever to show their mettle and lay hold of a safe return to their country; to the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="15.293" lat="37.0639">Syracusans</a> and their allies they cried that it would be glorious to prevent the escape of the enemy, and conquering, to exalt the countries that were theirs. 8 The generals, moreover, on either side, if they saw in any part of the battle backing ashore without being forced to do so, called out to the captain by name and asked him โ the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a>, whether they were retreating because they thought the thrice hostile shore more their own than that sea which had cost them so much labour to win; the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="15.293" lat="37.0639">Syracusans</a>, whether they were flying from the flying <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a>, whom they well knew to be eager to escape in whatever way they could. </p>                        </div>

Others, again, were gazing at some spot where the battle was evenly disputed; as the strife was protracted without decision, their swaying bodies reflected the agitation of their minds, and they suffered the worst agony of all, ever just within reach of safety or just on the point of destruction. 4 In short, in that one <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenian</a> army as long as the sea-fight remained doubtful there was every sound to be heard at once, shrieks, cheers, 'We win,' 'We lose,' and all the other manifold exclamations that a great host would necessarily utter in great peril; 5 and with the men in the fleet it was nearly the same; until at last the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="15.293" lat="37.0639">Syracusans</a> and their allies, after the battle had lasted a long while, put the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> to flight, and with much shouting and cheering chased them in open rout to the shore. 6 The naval force, one one way, one another, as many as were not taken afloat, now ran ashore and rushed from on board their ships to their camp; while the army, no more divided, but carried away by one impulse, all with shrieks and groans deplored the event, and ran down, some to help the ships, others to guard what was left of their wall, while the remaining and most numerous part already began to consider how they should save themselves. 7 Indeed, the panic of the present moment had never been surpassed.

So that the whole army being filled with tears and distracted after this fashion found it not easy to go, even from an enemy's land, where they had already suffered evils too great for tears and in the unknown future before them feared to suffer more. 5 Dejection and self-condemnation were also rife among them. Indeed they could only be compared to a starved-out town, and that no small one, escaping; the whole multitude upon the march being not less than forty thousand men. All carried anything they could which might be of use, and the heavy infantry and troopers, contrary to their wont, while under arms carried their own victuals, in some cases for want of servants, in others through not trusting them; as they had long been deserting and now did so in greater numbers than ever. Yet even thus they did not carry enough, as there was no longer food in the camp. 6 Moreover their disgrace generally, and the universality of their sufferings, however to a certain extent alleviated by being borne in company, were still felt at the moment a heavy burden, especially when they contrasted the splendor and glory of their setting out with the humiliation in which it had ended. 7 For this was by far the greatest reverse that ever befell an Hellenic army. They had come to enslave others, and were departing in fear of being enslaved themselves: they had sailed out with prayer and paeans, and now started to go back with omens directly contrary; travelling by land instead of by sea, and trusting not in their fleet but in their heavy infantry. Nevertheless the greatness of the danger still impending made all this appear tolerable. </p>                        </div>

Crowded in a narrow hole, without any roof to cover them, the heat of the sun and the stifling closeness of the air tormented them during the day, and then the nights which came on autumnal and chilly, made them ill by the violence of the change; 2 besides, as they had to do everything in the same place for want of room, and the bodies of those who died of their wounds or from the variation in the temperature, or from similar causes, were left heaped together one upon another, intolerable stenches arose; while hunger and thirst never ceased to afflict them, each man during eight months having only half a pint of water and a pint of corn given him daily. In short, no single suffering to be apprehended by men thrust into such a place was spared them. 3 For some seventy days they thus lived all together, after which all, except the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> and any <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="14.5" lat="37.6">Siceliots</a> or Italiots who had joined in the expedition, were sold. 4 The total number of prisoners taken it would be difficult to state exactly, but it could not have been less than seven thousand. 5 This was the greatest Hellenic achievement of any in this war, or, in my opinion, in Hellenic history; at once most glorious to the victors, and most calamitous to the conquered. 6 They were beaten at all points and altogether; all that they suffered was great; they were destroyed, as the saying is, with a total destruction, their fleet, their army โ everything was destroyed, and few out of many returned home.

The cheapest plan was to let the Hellenes wear each other out, at a small share of the expense and without risk to himself. 3 Besides, he would find the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> the most convenient partners in empire as they did not aim at conquests on shore, and carried on the war upon principles and with a practice most advantageous to the king; being prepared to combine to conquer the sea for <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>, and for the king all the Hellenes inhabiting his country, whom the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a>, on the contrary, had come to liberate.

Some persons crossed over from <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam" class="place modal-trigger" long="26.935" lat="37.695">Samos</a> and had an interview with <a href="https://topostext.org/people/52" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a>, who immediately offered to make first <a href="https://topostext.org/people/163" target="_blank">Tissaphernes</a>, and afterwards the king, their friend, if they would give up the democracy, and make it possible for the king to trust them. The higher class, who also suffered most severely from the war, now conceived great hopes of getting the government into their own hands, and of triumphing over the enemy. 2 Upon their return to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam" class="place modal-trigger" long="26.935" lat="37.695">Samos</a> the emissaries formed their partisans into a club, and openly told the mass of the armament that the king would be their friend, and would provide them with money, if <a href="https://topostext.org/people/52" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a> were restored, and the democracy abolished. 3 The multitude, if at first irritated by these intrigues, were nevertheless kept quiet by the advantageous prospect of the pay from the king; and the oligarchical conspirators, after making this communication to the people, now re-examined the proposals of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/52" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a> among themselves, with most of their associates. 4 Unlike the rest, who thought them advantageous and trustworthy, <a href="https://topostext.org/people/456" target="_blank">Phrynichus</a>, who was still general, by no means approved of the proposals. <a href="https://topostext.org/people/52" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a>, he rightly thought, cared no more for an oligarchy than for a democracy, and only sought to change the institutions of his country in order to get himself recalled by his associates; while for themselves their one object should be to avoid civil discord. It was not the king's interest, when the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> were now their equals at sea, and in possession of some of the chief cities in his empire, to go out of his way to side with the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> whom he did not trust, when he might make friends of the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> who had never injured him. 5 And as for the allied states to whom oligarchy was now offered, because the democracy was to be put down at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>, he well knew that this would not make the rebels come in any the sooner, or confirm the loyal in their allegiance; as the allies would never prefer servitude with an oligarchy or democracy to freedom with the constitution which they actually enjoyed, to whichever type it belonged. 6 Besides, the cities thought that the so-called better classes would prove just as oppressive as the commons, as being those who originated, proposed, and for the most part benefited from the acts of the commons injurious to the confederates. Indeed, if it depended on the better classes, the confederates would be put to death without trial and with violence; while the commons were their refuge and the chastiser of these men. 7 This he positively knew that the cities had learned by experience, and that such was their opinion. The propositions of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/52" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a>, and the intrigues now in progress, could therefore never meet with his approval. </p>                        </div>

However, the Assembly and the Council of the Bean still met notwithstanding, although they discussed nothing that was not approved of by the conspirators, who both supplied the speakers, and reviewed in advance what they were to say. 2 Fear, and the sight of the numbers of the conspirators, closed the mouths of the rest; or if any ventured to rise in opposition, he was presently put to death in some convenient way, and there was neither search for the murderers nor justice to be had against them if suspected; but the people remained motionless, being so thoroughly cowed that men thought themselves lucky to escape violence, even when they held their tongues. 3 An exaggerated belief in the numbers of the conspirators also demoralised the people, rendered helpless by the magnitude of the city, and by their want of intelligence with each other, and being without means of finding out what those numbers really were. 4 For the same reason it was impossible for any one to open his grief to a neighbour and to concert measures to defend himself, as he would have had to speak either to one whom he did not know, or whom he knew but did not trust. 5 Indeed all the popular party approached each other with suspicion, each thinking his neighbour concerned in what was going on, the conspirators having in their ranks persons whom no one could ever have believed capable of joining an oligarchy; and these it was who made the many so suspicious, and so helped to procure impunity for the few, by confirming the commons in their mistrust of one another. </p>                        </div>

Indeed, with the fleet in their hands, they were better able to provide themselves with supplies than the government at home. 5 It was their advanced position at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam" class="place modal-trigger" long="26.935" lat="37.695">Samos</a> which had throughout enabled the home authorities to command the entrance into <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a>; and if they refused to give them back the constitution, they would now find that the army was more in a position to exclude them from the sea than they were to exclude the army. 6 Besides, the city was of little or no use towards enabling them to overcome the enemy; and they had lost nothing in losing those who had no longer either money to send them โ the soldiers having to find this for themselves โ or good counsel, which entitles cities to direct armies. On the contrary, even in this the home government had done wrong in abolishing the institutions of their ancestors, while the army maintained the said institutions, and would try to force the home government to do so likewise. So that even in point of good counsel the camp had as good counsellors as the city. 7 Moreover, they had but to grant him security for his person and his recall, and <a href="https://topostext.org/people/52" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a> would be only too glad to procure them the alliance of the king. And above all, if they failed altogether, with the navy which they possessed, they had numbers of places to retire to in which they would find cities and lands. </p>                        </div>

Now it was that <a href="https://topostext.org/people/52" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a> for the first time did the state a service, and one of the most signal kind. For when the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenians</a> at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam" class="place modal-trigger" long="26.935" lat="37.695">Samos</a> were bent upon sailing against their countrymen, in which case <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon" class="place modal-trigger" long="27.7" lat="38">Ionia</a> and the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel" class="place modal-trigger" long="26.4" lat="40.2">Hellespont</a> would most certainly at once have passed into possession of the enemy, <a href="https://topostext.org/people/52" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a> it was who prevented them. 5 At that moment, when no other man would have been able to hold back the multitude, he put a stop to the intended expedition, and rebuked and turned aside the resentment felt, on personal grounds, against the envoys; 6 he dismissed them with an answer from himself, to the effect that he did not object to the government of the Five Thousand, but insisted that the Four Hundred should be deposed and the Council of Five Hundred reinstated in power: meanwhile any retrenchments for economy, by which pay might be better found for the armament, met with his entire approval. 7 Generally, he bade them hold out and show a bold face to the enemy, since if the city were saved there was good hope that the two parties might some day be reconciled, whereas if either were once destroyed, that at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam" class="place modal-trigger" long="26.935" lat="37.695">Samos</a>, or that at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>, there would no longer be any one to be reconciled to. 8 Meanwhile arrived envoys from the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.7195" lat="37.6316">Argives</a>, with offers of support to the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenian</a> commons at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam" class="place modal-trigger" long="26.935" lat="37.695">Samos</a>: these were thanked by <a href="https://topostext.org/people/52" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a>, and dismissed with a request to come when called upon. 9 The <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.7195" lat="37.6316">Argives</a> were accompanied by the crew of the <a href="https://topostext.org/people/11003" target="_blank">Paralus</a>, whom we left placed in a troopship by the Four Hundred with orders to cruise round <a about="https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.87" lat="38.53">Euboea</a>, and who being employed to carry to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemon</a> some <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenian</a> envoys sent by the Four Hundred, <a href="https://topostext.org/people/7848" target="_blank">Laespodias</a>, <a href="https://topostext.org/people/979" target="_blank">Aristophon</a>, and <a href="https://topostext.org/people/3425" target="_blank">Melesias</a>, as they sailed by <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.7195" lat="37.6316">Argos</a> laid hands upon the envoys, and delivering them over to the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.7195" lat="37.6316">Argives</a> as the chief subverters of the democracy, themselves, instead of returning to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athens</a>, took the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.7195" lat="37.6316">Argive</a> envoys on board, and came to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam" class="place modal-trigger" long="26.935" lat="37.695">Samos</a> in the galley which had been confided to them. </p>                        </div>

Some think that he went away in pursuance of his plan of wasting the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesian</a> resources, since at any rate <a href="https://topostext.org/people/3085" target="_blank">Tamos</a>, his lieutenant, far from being any better, proved a worse paymaster than himself: others that he brought the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="35.4" lat="33.5">Phoenicians</a> to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp" class="place modal-trigger" long="31.172" lat="36.939">Aspendus</a> to exact money from them for their discharge, having never intended to employ them: others again that it was in view of the outcry against him at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="place modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemon</a>, in order that it might be said that he was not in fault, but that the ships were really manned and that he had certainly gone to fetch them. 4 To myself it seems only too evident that he did not bring up the fleet because he wished to wear out and paralyse the Hellenic forces, that is, to waste their strength by the time lost during his journey to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp" class="place modal-trigger" long="31.172" lat="36.939">Aspendus</a>, and to keep them evenly balanced by not throwing his weight into either scale. Had he wished to finish the war, he could have done so, assuming of course that he made his appearance in a way which left no room for doubt; as by bringing up the fleet he would in all probability have given the victory to the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemonians</a>, whose navy, even as it was, faced the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="23.72793" lat="37.9718">Athenian</a> more as an equal than as an inferior. 5 But what convicts him most clearly, is the excuse which he put forward for not bringing the ships. He said that the number assembled was less than the king had ordered; but surely it would only have enhanced his credit if he spent little of the king's money and effected the same end at less cost. 6 In any case, whatever was his intention, <a href="https://topostext.org/people/163" target="_blank">Tissaphernes</a> went to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp" class="place modal-trigger" long="31.172" lat="36.939">Aspendus</a> and saw the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="35.4" lat="33.5">Phoenicians</a>; and the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel" class="ethnic modal-trigger" long="22.15" lat="37.54">Peloponnesians</a> at his desire sent a <a about="https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa" class="demonym modal-trigger" long="22.4237" lat="37.0821">Lacedaemonian</a> called <a href="https://topostext.org/people/26" target="_blank">Philip</a> with two galleys to fetch the fleet. </p>                        </div>

For all at once pretend to be not only equals but each the chief and master of his fellows; while under a democracy a disappointed candidate accepts his defeat more easily, because he has not the humiliation of being beaten by his equals. 4 But what most clearly encouraged the malcontents was the power of <a href="https://topostext.org/people/52" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a> at <a about="https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam" class="place modal-trigger" long="26.935" lat="37.695">Samos</a>, and their own disbelief in the stability of the oligarchy; and it was now a race between them as to which should first become the leader of the commons. </p>                        </div>

Further inaction had therefore now become impossible. 4 In the end, after a great many seditious harangues and suspicions, they set to work in real earnest. The heavy infantry in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a> building the wall in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236XEet" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6344" lat="37.9465">Eetionia</a>, among whom was <a href="https://topostext.org/people/432" target="_blank">Aristocrates</a>, a colonel, with his own tribe, laid hands upon <a href="https://topostext.org/people/5424" target="_blank">Alexicles</a>, a general under the oligarchy and the devoted adherent of the cabal, and took him into a house and confined him there. 5 In this they were assisted by one <a href="https://topostext.org/people/12141" target="_blank">Hermon</a>, commander of the <a href="https://topostext.org/people/5172" target="_blank">Peripoli</a> in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379237HMou" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.658" lat="37.938">Munychia</a>, and others, and above all had with them the great bulk of the heavy infantry. 6 As soon as the news reached the Four Hundred, who happened to be sitting in the council chamber, all except the disaffected wished at once to go to the posts where the arms were, and menaced <a href="https://topostext.org/people/378" target="_blank">Theramenes</a> and his party. <a href="https://topostext.org/people/378" target="_blank">Theramenes</a> defended himself, and said that he was ready immediately to go and help to rescue <a href="https://topostext.org/people/5424" target="_blank">Alexicles</a>; and taking with him one of the generals belonging to his party, went down to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a>, followed by <a href="https://topostext.org/people/340" target="_blank">Aristarchus</a> and some young men of the cavalry. 7 All was now panic and confusion. Those in the city imagined that <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a> was already taken and the prisoner put to death, while those in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a> expected every moment to be attacked by the party in the city. 8 The older men, however, stopped the persons running up and down the town and making for the stands of arms; and <a href="https://topostext.org/people/193" target="_blank">Thucydides</a> the <a about="https://topostext.org/place/393224UPha" class="person modal-trigger" long="22.3869" lat="39.2883">Pharsalian</a>, <a href="https://topostext.org/people/640" target="_blank">Proxenus</a> of the city, came forward and threw himself in the way of the rival factions, and appealed to them not to ruin the state, while the enemy was still at hand waiting for his opportunity, and so at length succeeded in quieting them and in keeping their hands off each other. 9 Meanwhile <a href="https://topostext.org/people/378" target="_blank">Theramenes</a> came down to <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a>, being himself one of the generals, and raged and stormed against the heavy infantry, while <a href="https://topostext.org/people/340" target="_blank">Aristarchus</a> and the adversaries of the people were angry in right earnest. 10 Most of the heavy infantry, however, went on with the business without faltering, and asked <a href="https://topostext.org/people/378" target="_blank">Theramenes</a> if he thought the wall had been constructed for any good purpose, and whether it would not be better that it should be pulled down. To this he answered that if they thought it best to pull it down, he for his part agreed with them. Upon this the heavy infantry and a number of the people in <a about="https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei" class="place modal-trigger" long="23.6448" lat="37.9394">Piraeus</a> immediately got up on the fortification and began to demolish it. 11 Now their cry to the multitude was that all should join in the work who wished the Five Thousand to govern instead of the Four Hundred. For instead of saying in so many words 'all who wished the commons to govern' they still disguised themselves under the name of the Five Thousand; being afraid that these might really exist, and that they might be speaking to one of their number and get into trouble through ignorance. Indeed this was why the Four Hundred neither wished the Five Thousand to exist, nor to have it known that they did not exist; being of opinion that to give themselves so many partners in empire would be downright democracy, while the mystery in question would make the people afraid of one another. </p>                        </div>
