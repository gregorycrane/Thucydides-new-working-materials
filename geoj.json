It was inhabited from the Neolithic period until the foundation and development of the Minoan palaces in the 15th century B.C. <br>The Minoan city covered a considerable area around the palatial centre. After the destruction of the palace in the 15th century, the city continued to be inhabited in the Mycenaean and Geometric periods, that is, until the 8th century B.C. <br>Later, the temple of Rhea was built to the south of the old palace. The Hellenistic city was extremely prosperous; houses of the period are to be seen in the west court (upper terrace) of the palace. In the middle of the 2nd century B.C. it was destroyed and dominated by the neighbouring city of Gortyn. Traces of habitation dating from the Venetian period are scattered in the whole area. The archaeological investigation of Phaistos started in 1884 by F. Halbherr and continued by the Italian Archaeological School at Athens, under the direction of F. Halbherr and L. Pernier in 1900-1904 and by Doro Levi, in 1950-1971.<br>The most important monuments of the site are: <br>- The Palaces (old and new). They are built of ashlar blocks and spread on different terraces. To the central, peristyle court are opened the royal quarters, the storerooms, a lustral basin, and workshops. The monumental propylon and the large staircases faciliate access to the many terraces. <br>- Minoan and later town. Sections of the town have been located at the sites called Chalara and Aghia Photeini, SE and NE of the palace, respectively. <br>- Venetian church of St. George of Phalandra.

Here, Apostle Titus preached Christianity and in A.D. 250 the Ten Saints martyred. In A.D. 824 the city, which had become the seat of an Archbishop, was destroyed by the Arabs. <br>The first investigations on the site were conducted in 1884 by the Italian archaeologist F. Halbherr. Since then, excavations have been carried out by the Italian Archaeological School and the 23rd Ephorate. <br>Some of the uncovered buildings were consolidated during the excavations.

It is the largest of the preserved Minoan palatial centres. Four wings are arranged around a central courtyard, containing the royal quarters, workshops, shrines, storerooms, repositories, the throne room and banquet halls. Dated to 2000-1350 B.C. <br> The Little Palace. It lies to the west of the main palace and has all the features of palatial architecture: scraped wall masonry, reception rooms, a pristyle hall, a double megaron with polythyra (pi er-and-door partitions) and a lustral basin-shrine. Dated to the 17th-15th centuries B.C. <br> The Royal Villa. It lies to the NE of the palace and its architectural form is distinguished by the polythyra, the pillar crypt and the double staircase, with two flights of stairs. It is strongly religious in character and might have been the residence of an aristocrat or a high priest. Dated to the 14th century B.C. <br> House of the Frescoes. It is located to the NW of the palace and is a small urban mansion with rich decoration on the walls. Dated to the 15th, 14th-12th centuries B.C. <br> Caravanserai. It lies to the south of the palace and was interpreted as a reception hall and hospice. Some of the rooms are equipped with baths and decorated with wall paintings. <br> The 'Unexplored Mansion'. Private building, probably of private-industrial function, to the NW of the palace. It is rectangular, with a central, four-pillared hall, corridors, storerooms and remains of a staircase. Dated to the 14th-12th centuries B.C. <br> Temple Tomb. It is located almost 600 m. to the south of the palace and was connected with the 'House of the High Priest' by means of a paved street. It seems that one of the last kings of Knossos (17th-14th centuries B.C.) was buried here. Typical features of its architecture are the hypostyle, two-pillar crypt, the entrance with the courtyard, the portico and a small anteroom. <br>House of the High Priest. It lies 300 m. to the south of Caravanserai and contains a stone altar with two columns, framed by the bases of double axes. <br>The South Mansion. Private civic house, located to the south of the palace. It is a three-storeyed building with a lustral basin and a hypostyle crypt, dating from the 17th-15th centuries B.C. <br>Villa of Dionysos. Private, peristyle house of the Roman period. It is decorated with splendid mosaics by Apollinarius, depicting Dionysos. The house contains special rooms employed for the Dionysiac cult. Dated to the 2nd century A.D.<br>Knossos is the site of the most important and better known palace of Minoan civilization. According to tradition, it was the seat of the legendary king Minos. The Palace is also connected with thrilling legends, such as the myth of the Labyrinth with the Minotaur, and the story of Daidalos and Icaros. <br>The site was continuously inhabited from the Neolithic period (7000-3000 B.C.) until Roman times. <br>The Linear B tablets (Mycenaean script) of the 14th century B.C. mention the city as ko-no-so. <br>Intensive habitation occured mostly in the Minoan period, when the so-called first (19th-17th centuries B.C.) and second palaces (16th-14th centuries B.C.) were built along with luxurious houses, a hospice and various other structures. After its partial destruction in 1450 B.C., Knossos was settled by Mycenaeans from the Greek Mainland. <br>The city flourished again during the Hellenistic period (sanctuaries of Glaukos, Demeter, other sanctuaries, chamber tombs, north cemetery, defensive towers) and in 67 B.C. it was captured by the Roman Quintus Caecilius Metelus Creticus. The 'Villa of Dionysos', a private house with splendid mosaics was built in the same period. <br>Knossos was discovered in 1878 by Minos Kalokairinos. Arthur Evans conducted systematic excavations at the site between 1900 and 1931, bringing to light the palace, a large section of the Minoan city, and the cemeteries. Since then, the site and the surrounding area have been excavated by the British School of Archaeology at Athens and the 23rd E.P.C.A. <br>\u00abThe restoration of the palace to its present form was carried out by Arthur Evans. The interventions were mostly imposed by the need to preserve the monuments uncovered. The Archaeological Service of the Ministry of Culture carries out only consolidation work, whenever necessary.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q173527'>Wikidata ID: Q173527<\/a>","name":"Knossos","modSource2":2,"placeID":"353252PKno","timePer":"BGACHRL","travelogues":10553,"pleiades":589872,"country":"Greece","region":"Crete","dept":"Irakleio","2011LG":"Irakleiou","1997LG":"Irakleiou","pre97":"Irakleiou","mod":"Knosos","works":62,"regionKML":"Crete3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2","concat1":"Knossos (Crete)","greek2":"\u039a\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u1f79\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/589872","webPageData":22252,"work_id":2,"placeid":144,"count":2}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.5655000000000001136868377216160297393798828125,35.31439999999999912461134954355657100677490234375]},"properties":{"pk":152,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":9,"priority":5,"ModSource":1,"latitude":35.31439999999999912461134954355657100677490234375,"longitude":25.5655000000000001136868377216160297393798828125,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u039c\u03af\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 - Milatos?, Archaic to Hellenistic polis near modern Milatos? in Lasithi Crete","concat2":"Milatos (Crete) 9 Paralia Milatou - \u039c\u03af\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"Buildings of Geometric, Archaic and Hellenistic times are visible.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17325188'>Wikidata ID: Q17325188<\/a>","name":"Milatos?","modSource2":1,"placeID":"353256PMil","timePer":"ACH","travelogues":"","pleiades":589932,"country":"Greece","region":"Crete","dept":"Lasithi","2011LG":"Agiou Nikolaou","1997LG":"Vrachasiou","pre97":"Milatou","mod":"Paralia Milatou","works":5,"regionKML":"Crete4","styleID":"PolisLow","dateRevised":20150314,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039c\u03af\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Milatos (Crete)","greek2":"\u039c\u03af\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u039c\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/589932","webPageData":28816,"work_id":2,"placeid":152,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[26.937999999999998834709913353435695171356201171875,35.40400000000000346744855050928890705108642578125]},"properties":{"pk":181,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":24,"priority":4,"ModSource":5,"latitude":35.40400000000000346744855050928890705108642578125,"longitude":26.937999999999998834709913353435695171356201171875,"confidence":"High","description":"\u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 - Kasos, Island polis with Archaic to Roman remains, the modern Kastro\/Poli on Kasos, Dodecanese","concat2":"Kasos island (Dodecanese) 24 Kastro\/Poli - \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlement.png","modernDescr":"KASOS paid a terrible price for the conspicuous role which its merchant fleet \u2013 hastily commissioned as warships \u2013 played in the War of Greek Independence in the early 1820's: in June of 1824 the island's buildings were razed, its land and trees torched, the active male population slaughtered and the rest sold into slavery in an act of vengeance at the hands of the Egyptian allies of the Ottoman Sultan, comparable in spirit with what happened on Psar\u00e1 and Chios in the same years.  The economy and ecology have only with difficulty begun to recover from this catastrophe.  In spite of all this, an unassuming and business-like optimism prevails, which makes visiting Kasos a pleasure, even though its infrastructure and accommodations are still very simple.  There are a few sandy beaches, the best of which are on the uninhabited, outlying islets to the north. <br>The Phoenician \u2018kas', meaning sea-spray, is probably the origin of the name \u2018Kasos': the island's waters have always been famous for their unpredictability and choppiness.  Even though other names for the island appear in Pliny and Stephanos Byzantios (\u2018Astrabe', \u2018Amphe' & \u2018Achne'), the island and its city were commonly known by the name \u2018Kasos' throughout history.  There are scattered traces of a human presence on Kasos (the cave of Ellinokamara) and its outlying islets (Arm\u00e1thia) from the 4th and 3rd millennia BC; but the earliest explored settlements on the island, show strong Minoan influence and were in the vicinity of Helatros Bay, the island's only sheltered inlet at its southwest corner \u2013 the closest point to Crete.  These functioned up until c. 1450 BC, after which, with the building of a Mycenaean citadel at Poli, the centre of settlement moved to the north of the island where it has remained until today.  Homer (Iliad, II. 676) mentions Kasos participating in the Trojan war with other Dodecanesian islands.  The first historical record of the island is in the tribute lists of the Delian League; and Kasiot theoroi, or legates, are recorded at Delos in 275\/4 BC.  Kasos, even though apparently independent in this period, seems not to have minted its own coins, and after its incorporation into the Rhodian state in the first half of the 2nd century BC used exclusively Rhodian coinage. <br>With the eradication of Aegean piracy by Pompey the Great after 67 BC, the main settlement of the island moved to the coast, near the site of today's Emborei\u00f3.  Here it slowly increased in prosperity, culminating in the building of at least two large, Early Christian basilicas and other public buildings.  The return of piracy to the seas and the constant threat of Saracen attack meant that settlement abandoned the shores and retreated inland once again.  In the Byzantine Empire the island belonged to the theme of Crete.  In 1207 it was captured by the Venetians, was briefly taken by the Knights of St. John in 1311, but then returned to Venetian overlords \u2013 the Cornaro family \u2013 again in 1315, together with Karpathos.  After the Turks took the island in 1537, Suleiman the Magnificent granted the island some self-government in return for the maktou, or annual tribute. <br>Already in the late 17th century the mercantile fleet of Kasos numbered almost 100 ships \u2013 a remarkable size for an island with effectively no good, natural harbour.  By 1820 the number had grown to almost 700, with a population of islanders of more than 9,000.  In the feverish atmosphere of the evolving War of Independence, the fleet became a fighting navy and was turned over to the cause of Greek independence, pursuing raids on the Asia Minor and Levantine coasts.  In July 1821 Kasos fought bravely for the liberation of Crete and became a place of refuge for Cretans.  These actions provoked the Ottoman Sultan to seek the help of the substantial forces of Mohammed Ali, Khedive of Egypt.  In May 1824 the Egyptian navy, under the command of Mohammed Ali's son, Ibrahim Pasha, sailed for Kasos and besieged the island; on June 7th, in a catastrophe never forgotten on the island, the population was massacred and their lands burnt.  Males were slaughtered and women and children shipped to Alexandria to be sold into slavery.  The island was left abandoned for several years. <br>By 1830 the few who had escaped and survived were beginning to return and, with the resilience that has always characterised the Aegean islanders, began to rebuild a life on Kasos.  By 1843, there was once again a merchant fleet of 75 ships.  The 1850s and 1860s saw considerable emigration by Kasiots \u2013 ironically \u2013 to Egypt to participate in the building of the Suez canal.  Italian occupation in 1912 and the development of steam ships, contributed to the slow demise of the Kasiot fleet.  In 1948, Kasos joined the Greek State together with the other islands of the Dodecanese.  Neither the economy nor the island's vegetation has ever truly recovered from the purge of 1824.  The resident population today \u2013 just over 1,000 \u2013 is a tenth of what it was in the heyday of the early 19th century.<br>The village of P\u00f3li, whose name indicates that it stands on the site of Kasos, the ancient \u2018polis' of the island.  The attractive and panoramic site, partially protected from view and from the wind, served also as capital and main settlement of the island throughout the Middle Ages.  The village clusters round the Church of the Aghia Triada (Holy Trinity) of 1868, which is paved throughout with fine chochlakia pebble-work: its sober black and white colour sets off the fine iconostasis with unusual gilded, trompe l'oeuil \u2018scallop niches' over the principal icons.  The hillside opposite the church functioned as the acropolis of ancient Kasos.   <br>A wealth of surface pottery finds from the hill (displayed in the Museum in Phry) shows that the site was occupied in the Early Bronze Age, Minoan, Mycenaean, Geometric, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, Roman and Early Christian times, with perhaps almost continuous habitation.  A constructed citadel was probably first created here in Mycenaean times.  Visible on the eastern side are the lower courses of a 4th century fortification wall of roughly squared blocks. It was the lower southern slopes of the hill, and the facing slope to the south, which yielded the 51 circular, inscribed grave-markers which are unique to Kasos from an area occupied by a 4th and 3rd century BC cemetery. An inscription from Olous in eastern Crete refers to a sanctuary of Apollo Temenites on Kasos, which may have stood on the acropolis here.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q65082025'>Wikidata ID: Q65082025<\/a>","name":"Kasos","modSource2":5,"placeID":"354269PKas","timePer":"ACHR","travelogues":13507,"pleiades":589845,"country":"Greece","region":"Dodecanese","dept":"Karpathos\/Kasos","2011LG":"Kasou","1997LG":"Kasou","pre97":"Kasou","mod":"Kastro\/Poli","works":11,"regionKML":"Dodecanese4","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Kasos island (Dodecanese)","greek2":"\u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2361853,"PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/589845","webPageData":28789,"work_id":2,"placeid":181,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[27.13329999999999841975295566953718662261962890625,35.58330000000000126192389870993793010711669921875]},"properties":{"pk":203,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":81,"priority":3,"ModSource":5,"latitude":35.58330000000000126192389870993793010711669921875,"longitude":27.13329999999999841975295566953718662261962890625,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u039a\u03ac\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 - Karpathos, island, the modern Karpathos, Dodecanese Greece","concat2":"Karpathos (Dodecanese) 81 Karpathos - \u039a\u03ac\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"island","icon":"region3.png","modernDescr":"Karpathos has the wildest landscape and coastal waters of the Dodecanese.  For this it was famous also in Antiquity: Horace cites with awe the rough expanses of the \u2018Carpathium mare' two times in his Odes (I. 35 \u2018To Fortuna', & IV. 5).  With a marginally larger area than Cos, Karpathos is the biggest island of the Dodecanese after Rhodes.  Its northern half is a steep, sculpted ridge of mountains that drop abruptly to the sea, while the southern tip of the island is an open landscape of soft, eroded sandstone. Between the two lies the moderately fertile area of springs and low hills where the majority of the population is concentrated.  <br>Even though Homer calls it \u2018Krapathos' <sic> , the island was always known as Karpathos in Antiquity. The mediaeval name of Scarpanto was revived by the Italians at the beginning of the last century and is still sometimes used: the Turks called it Kerpe.   Evidence of a Neolithic presence on Karpathos as early as the beginning of the 4th millennium BC has been found on the acropolis headland at Pigadia, and in 1886 the British Museum was presented with a Neolithic limestone figure found there. A seasonal rather than settled presence in this period is attested at over a dozen other points on both Karpathos and Saria.  By the 2nd millennium BC, the island begins to show the overt influence and presence of Cretan, Minoan culture. Almost a hundred Bronze Age vases have been recovered from tombs, reinforcing the evidence for occupation during this period.  Minoan and Mycenaean remains have been found at many sites, both in the Pigadia area and at other points around the island; these include a significant number of agricultural installations in the more fertile, south of the island.  Around 1000 BC, colonisation by Dorian settlers from Argos in the Peloponnese began.  <br>From 477 BC the communities of the island appear in Athenian tribute lists of the Delian League.  It is at this point that some confusion arises. The lists mention the communities of Arkaseia and Brykous, whose sites are both known to us, and of Saros on the island of Saria to the north; but they also mention \u2018Karpathians' and \u2018Eteokarpathians' (i.e. \u2018original' Karpathians).  We know that the modern capital of Pigadia occupies the site of the ancient port called Potidaion, which is referred to in inscriptions but curiously not mentioned in the tribute lists. Although it was probably the most important centre on the island, it may only have been a dependency or \u2018outport' of the deme of Karpathos \u2013  having a relationship in some ways similar to that of Piraeus to Athens.  This still leaves the site of Karpathos, the ancient capital, unidentified \u2013 though some have suggested that it was in the area of Aperi and that the city was the result of a \u2018synoecism' of communities.  Strabo later adds fuel to the confusion by mentioning four cities (Geog. X, 5.17): three of which are familiar \u2013 Karpathos, Arkaseia, Brykous \u2013 plus one other, about which nothing is known: Nisyros. This could possibly refer to an older centre which was defunct by the Classical period; but there is also a disputed suggestion that Nisyros was on the island of Saria. This aside, we still have the \u2018Eteokarpathians' to account for.  They were, as their name implies, a community of aboriginal inhabitants who it is thought originally occupied the centre of the island in the region of the modern villages of Othos, Volada and Pini, where they had a sanctuary of Apollo; they are not heard of after the 5th century BC, and may have lost their independent identity by inter-marriage and mixing with the settlers, rather as the Etruscans did under Roman domination.  In the 4th century BC the island was incorporated into the Rhodian state, and in 42 AD was annexed by Rome. <br>In the Early Byzantine period the island was under the archdiocese of Rhodes.  In 680 AD the Bishop of Karpathos participated in the Sixth Oecumenical Council of Constantinople, in spite of the fact that the period of the 7th \u201310th centuries saw the island consistently raided by Arab pirates, some of whom appear to have established bases on Karpathos and Saria.  In the last decade of the 11th century the Byzantine fleet used the island as a supply base for its campaign to suppress uprisings on Crete. The Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus gave the island in fief to the Genoese adventurers and brothers, Andrea and Lodovico Moresco.  In 1306 it was acquired by the Cornaro family of Venice.  The Knights of St John of Rhodes took over the island in 1315, but held it for only two years before returning it to Andrea Cornaro, under a threat from Venice which amounted to an act of financial extortion.  Cristoforo Buondelmonti visited the island in c. 1415 and observed (with displeasure) how the inhabitants were employed in the production of a \u2018foul-smelling', resinous pitch. The Cornaro dynasty finally surrendered Karpathos to the Turks in 1538.  <br>In 1823 the island was momentarily liberated during the War of Greek Independence and joined to fledgling Greek State, before being returned again to Turkey in 1830.  Five years later, Sultan Mahmut II allowed Karpathos beneficial financial privileges. In 1892 the Turkish Governor made Pigadia the capital of the island.  Karpathos finally joined the Greek State, together with the other Dodecanese Islands, in May 1948.  Links with, and financial support from, Karpathian emigr\u00e9s in Australia and the USA are particularly strong: in 1966 a large convention of the \u2018diaspora' was held to plan the economic future of the island.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q65082020'>Wikidata ID: Q65082020<\/a>","name":"Karpathos","modSource2":5,"placeID":"356271IKar","timePer":"","travelogues":13506,"pleiades":589841,"country":"Greece","region":"Dodecanese","dept":"Karpathos","2011LG":"Karpathou","1997LG":"Karpathou","pre97":"Voladas","mod":"Karpathos","works":32,"regionKML":"Dodecanese4","styleID":"Region3","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03ac\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Karpathos (Dodecanese)","greek2":"\u039a\u03ac\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/589841","webPageData":41463,"work_id":2,"placeid":203,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.088200000000000500222085975110530853271484375,36.09129999999999682813722756691277027130126953125]},"properties":{"pk":223,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":107,"priority":3,"ModSource":5,"latitude":36.09129999999999682813722756691277027130126953125,"longitude":28.088200000000000500222085975110530853271484375,"confidence":"High","description":"\u039b\u1f77\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 - Lindos, Archaic to Late Antique polis on Rhodes, Lindos, Dodecanese","concat2":"Lindos (Dodecanese) 107 Lindos - \u039b\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"polis.png","modernDescr":"From a distance\u2014whether approaching by sea or by land\u2014 the reason for the founding and for the enduring importance of Lindos is clear: an isolated and panoramic natural rock acropolis and two splendid bays for ports. In addition, there is a plentiful spring. These three elements compensated for a terrain which offered little possibility of agriculture and meant that Ancient Lindos, unlike Ialysos and Kameiros, had to live primarily on trade. Of the three ancient Dorian cities it was always the most important and maintained its influence, especially as a religious centre, long after the 5th century BC synoecism and the creation of the federal state of Rhodes. Lindos acquired prestige also through her early colonies, in particular Gela in Sicily and Phaselis in Lycia on the south coast of Asia Minor. The Lindians excelled in navigation and maritime commerce, developing a code of law for shipping on which \u2018Rhodian (Maritime) Law' was later based: this in turn became the basis for Roman and, indirectly, modern, Maritime Law.<br>Neolithic and Mycenaean occupation of the promontory are attested by archaeology, while the cult of Athena Lindia appears to go back at least to the 10th century BC. Most of what the visitor sees today, however, dates from a later re-building during the 4th century BC. The site was too important to neglect in later epochs; passing crusaders and expanding Venetian trade brought Lindos prosperity in the 12th century, further nurtured by the Knights of St John who expanded the population over that of Byzantime times, fortified the acropolis and stationed a permanent garrison here. The prosperity of many of the families of Lindos is reflected both in the dignified and decorated mansions which are to be found in the narrow streets of the lower town and in the finely painted churches.<br>ACROPOLIS (Open Apr\u2013Oct 8\u20137.30; Nov\u2013Mar 8.30\u20132.30; closed Mon only in winter.) The inhabited settlement was never contiguous with the acropolis, but separated by a clear break of open rock and pinetrees. Visible to the right before reaching the entrance gate to the acropolis, are ancient votive inscriptions to the gods cut into the facets of the rock outcrops beside the pathway. (A couple\u2014one particularly long\u2014 may be seen clearly from the path as you climb up, at about shoulder height and higher, on the outcrop of naturally faceted rock to the right-hand side, just as the path turns right into the last straight stretch up to the entrance.) Once through the outer gate, there is a shaded terrace punctuated by three prominent mouths of large, plaster-lined Byzantine cisterns: the acropolis had no spring within its walls, and depended on water collected in such cisterns; there are many more above, on the summit.<br>At the first turn in the path the visitor is faced with an impressive *votive relief of the stern of a ship, and to its left a dedicatory exedra\u2014both skillfully carved into the living rock. Though contiguous, these are two separate dedications. An inscription on the side of the ship states that the work was \u2018dedicated to Agesander, son of Mikion, by the people of Lindos', and that it was the work of the Rhodian sculptor, Pythocritus of the 3rd\/2nd centuries BC. Delicate chisel and point work can still be seen on the surface.<br>Stylistic similarities have linked the piece and its artist to the Winged Victory of Samothrace in the Louvre. The kind of ship meticulously portrayed here \u2013 the triemiolia - possessed two rudders or steering paddles: visible are the helmsman's station on the near side, and a part of the serpentine shape of the rudder holding (something similar can be seen on a Venetian gondola). A break in the carving shows where a sculpted rudder itself would have projected downwards\u2014if not in stone, perhaps added in wood. The boat's deck acted as the base for a statue of Agesander, possibly wearing the golden crown referred to in the inscription below. The exedra to the left may be a little earlier; it surrounds a base on which an honorific statue would have stood. Much later, in the 3rd century AD, the long inscription (originally picked out in red) was added by Aglochartos, priest of Athena Lindia.<br>To the left of the present stairs leading up to the acropolis there are vestiges of the ancient Sacred Way and steps. Much higher up to the left, is a flight of 14th century steps added by the Knights of St John, which originally gave access directly into the Governor's Residence by means of a wooden drawbridge. The Residence\u2014now extensively restored\u2014dates from the period of Grand Master Pierre d'Aubusson (1476\u20131503) and bears his arms in grey Lardos marble high up on the exterior wall: its interior was once painted with garlands, landscapes and coats of arms. These have faded considerably, and some areas have been removed to safety in Rhodes; the building now houses the local archaeological offices. The security of the building relies\u2014as does the whole enceinte of walls\u2014on the natural defences of the steep site, rather than on any ingenious military architecture. Some substantial machicolations can be seen high above the main door however.<br>The vaulted entrance, containing a number of capitals and finely inscribed altars and statue bases, gives onto an inner esplanade covered with many more of the same. This (only a fraction of the total number on the site) gives some indication of the forest of votive statuary in bronze and marble, as well as paintings and other works of art, which would have greeted the pilgrim in ancient times: in addition to the mute evidence of these fragments, writers (Philostratos, Plutarch and Pliny) also mention the works of art and spoils of war which were dedicated here\u2014each piece vying for attention with the next.<br>The plateau of the acropolis is a roughly triangular area of 8,400sq. m rising to a height of 116m. The layout we see today dates from a building program begun in the 4th century BC; before that the Archaic Sacred Way had led across the open area, from the entrance directly up to the Temple of Athena at the summit. Some part of its paving can be seen in the floor, beside the long base of a Hellenistic monument, in the undercroft beneath the Governor's Residence reached by turning sharply to the left. This passage in turn leads out onto another esplanade crowded with more fragments of broken monuments. To the right, a line of (restored) vaulted chambers, originally built in the 1st century BC and used as storage spaces, support the first terrace of the grand approach to the Temple of Athena, created during the Hellenistic re-building. Just in front of the foot of the staircase that divides this line of vaults, is a rare and pleasing curiosity\u2014a block of stone on the ground which fortuitously preserves an ancient mason's sketch of a piece of lifting machinery, scratched into the surface facing away from the steps. To the left is a dark grey marble exedra which\u2014according to the inscription at its back\u2014was surmounted in the 3rd century BC by a bronze statue of Pamphilydas, priest of Athena. At the northern (left) extremity of the area once stood a Roman pro-style temple (no longer visible), which faced towards the Temple of Athena. The wide area in front, littered with ancient material, shows how four different colours of stone have been used on the acropolis: Lardos marble; an indigenous, mottled-grey marble quarried a few miles to the west of Lindos, sometimes tending to a solid, dark grey, used especially for inscribed surfaces; Cycladic marble (from Paros\/Naxos); small amounts of this have been used, mainly for sculptural needs or decorative refinement; a homogeneous, deep rust-red \u2018poros' limestone from the area of At\u00e1vyros; the honey-coloured \u2018poros' limestone of the native rock of the acropolis.<br>The grand ascent up to the temple at the summit is very much an expression of the Hellenistic mind\u2014symmetrical, cadenced, theatrical, and with a grandiose and rather impersonal sense of ceremony about it. Note how, although this approach is symmetrical within itself, the reason for its existence\u2014the Temple of Athena\u2014steadfastly refuses to be included in its axis and remains to one side, clinging to its historic site. There are three phases of building in the whole complex, which all followed on from the restoration of the temple itself after its destruction by fire in 392 BC: 1. the propylaia enclosing the temple's sanctuary at the top, which date from shortly after the fire, i.e. the early 4th century; 2. the wide stoa on the next level down which dates from 300\u2013290 BC; and 3. the terrace and vaulted storage areas below the stoa, which were the last elements to be added, around 100 BC.<br>As well as mentally preparing and physically corralling pilgrims for the approach to the temple, the wide stoa served as a shaded space where votive gifts\u2014especially paintings\u2014 could be exhibited. It has been minimally reconstructed at the beginning of the last century to give at least some idea of its form. Originally, the Doric colonnade would have run the entire width of the building (87m); but its roof was omitted in the centre to allow a clear view of the next flight of steps up to the main propylaia. These\u2014only visible in foundations now\u2014were in effect two contiguous propylaia: one symmetrical Doric colonnade at the top of the flight of stairs with two slightly projecting wings at either end; and an internal colonnade which was L-shaped, and which gave on to the temple. They marked the boundary of the sanctuary; access beyond this point was limited and the area could be entered only after ritual purification.<br>The Temple of Athena itself seems small after such a grand approach: it measures only 22m x 8m and is amphi-prostyle, tetrastyle in design, i.e. possessing a projecting four-column portico at either end. It hugs the very edge of the southern precipice: its placing, its size and its form, all faithful to the older Archaic temple that stood here until the fire of 392 BC, traces of whose crepidoma can be seen in the bed-rock of dark limestone inside the present building. There has been considerable restoration, but much of the west wall is original; the east wall rises straight from\u2014and seems to grow out of\u2014 the rock of the precipice. The stone would originally have been covered with a layer of light-coloured plaster.<br>The temple has a long history: according to Herodotus (Histories II.182) it was the Danaids in their flight from the sons of Aegyptus who established the cult; according to Diodorus (5.58.1) it was Danaus himself. One of the temple's early donors, the pharaoh Amasis, dedicated here a remarkable linen corselet. In 392 BC fire destroyed the temple and a great many of its dedications. When it was rebuilt, the worship of Zeus Polieus was added and, at the same time, Athena became identified as Athena \u2018Polias'. The original archaic cult statue inside the temple was probably a wooden image of the goddess, seated and wearing a golden diadem. It would have been protected by a railing. Such was the fame and influence of the statue of Athena Parthenos by Pheidias in Athens, however, that this original seated Athena was replaced in the 5th or 4th century by an image of the goddess, standing and armed\u2014as in the Parthenon. It must have been this statue that was transported to Byzantium by Theodosius in the 5th century AD when the temple cult was officially suppressed and which apparently perished in a fire there later that century.<br>The entrance to the temple was at the north: on either side of it were two inscribed plaques in grey Lardos marble with the chronological lists of the priests of Athena L ind ia, running from 406 BC through to 47 AD. These precious records were removed in the Middle Ages and used as floor slabs in the church of Aghios Stephanos, only to come to the world's attention again when the church was removed and the area excavated in early 1900s: they are rare historical documents of great value. In the narrow area in front of the south entrance are signs of extensive Archaic cutting in the bedrock. The view from the edge down to the perfectly formed natural harbour below, where tradition holds that St Paul took refuge from a storm, is unforgettable.<br>The pathway back to the exit, which descends by steps to the west, passes by a deep water-storage pool\u2014part natural, part cut into the bed-rock\u2014and continues to wards the massive supporting wall for the terrace of the western end of the stoa\u2014its regular, rectangular stone blocks, elaborately rusticated in customary Hellenistic fashion. Above it and to the north are the tall ruins of the three apses of the east end of the 13th century, Byzantine church of Aghios Ioannis . Its rounded windows and arches are a marked contrast to so much ancient rectilinearity.<br>Around the base of the Acropolis hill are three further important ancient sites. Below the southwest side, and reached by taking a right-hand (south) route through the lower town from the church of the Panaghia, is the ancient theatre (4th century BC), whose cavea of seats is cut into the living rock of the slope. Although only the central part is still visible today, its design is clear with a deep diazoma separating the lower nineteen rows of seats from the upper seven. It would have had a capacity of almost 2,000 spectators. Foundations which project in the centre, above the diazoma, probably supported a choregic monument and not a shrine to Dionysos, as was originally supposed. Opposite the cavea, and across the orchestra, the position of the original proscenium is marked by cuttings in the rock. Almost contiguous with the proscenium of the theatre are the remaining foundations of a large, almost square, building with peristyle which was constructed over a century later than the theatre. This cloister-like building is referred to as the Tetrasto\u00f6n; its exact function is unknown. The fact that no fewer than three churches had been built on the site in later times, and that a number of Christian burials were found here, would suggest that it was used for cultic purposes in antiquity, since it was always the habit of early Christian communities to transform places of pagan worship into churches or sacred Christian sites. It was here, in the floor of the now demolished church of Aghios Stephanos, that the inscribed stones with the lists of Athena's priests were found, as well as the \u2018Lindian Chronicle'. In 99 BC the people of Lindos commissioned an inscription recording the dedications that had been made in their temple to Athena since its foundation. Two men were selected and instructed to \u2018inscribe from the letters and public records and from any other evidence, whatever might be fitting regarding the offerings and the visible presence of the goddess'. First published by the Danish archaeologist, Christian Blinkenberg in 1912, it is known as the \u2018Lindian Chronicle', and is one of the longest inscriptions to have survived from the Hellenistic Greek world. It is now in the Archaeological Museum in Copenhagen. The chronicle gives the name of the dedicator, lists the objects dedicated (with a description of the material from which they were made and any inscription they might possess) and finally gives the \u2018sources' that named and described any objects that no longer existed. The dedications include gold, jewellery, weaponry, statuary (e.g. a \u2018cow and calf fashioned in wood', a \u2018wooden Gorgon with marble head', etc.). Amongst those who made the dedications, are mentioned Cleoboulos, Artaphernes (brother and general of the Persian king, Darius), Alexander the Great, Ptolemy I of Egypt, and Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. A fascinating final section of the inscription narrates three miraculous apparitions of Athena that occurred within the temple: the first during the Persian Wars when the goddess promised to intercede with Zeus; the second giving instructions concerning the proper steps to be followed after the pollution of the sanctuary caused by a person's suicide there; and the third (which were repeated appearances) during the siege of Rhodes by Demetrius Poliorcetes in 305\u20134 in which the goddess counseled seeking the help of Ptolemy of Egypt. Both for what it reveals of the \u2018historicising' cast of the Hellenistic mind and its emerging concern for \u2018documentary' authority and \necord, as well as for what it tells us about cultic practice and experience in the Greek world, the Chronicle is a uniquely important document.<br>From the Tetrasto\u00f6n and the Ancient theatre, it is a short walk down to the harbour of Aghios Pavlos, where St Paul is thought to have landed on Rhodes. Looking back towards the Acropolis from here, the wide, arching cave which undercuts the rock directly below the Temple of Athena is visible. Its name\u2014Panaghia Spiliotissa (Virgin of the Cave)\u2014 indicates that it was a place of early Christian worship, which followed a preceding pagan cult. The walls of the cave bear a late inscription of the 3rd century AD, with the name and title of one of the priests of Athena Lindia, Lucius Aelius Aglochartos\u2014perhaps the same individual who added the inscription to the exedra at the entrance to the acropolis, mentioned above.<br>Round the opposite side of the acropolis-rock, beyond the limits of the lower town and on the slope approximately 100m north\/northeast of the acropolis, is a site referred to as the Bouk\u00f3pion\u2014a \u2018place for the sacrifice of oxen': the name appears on inscriptions on the rock surfaces. The area seems to have had early cultic significance. Vestiges of foundations show there to have been also a small temple of the Geometric period here (10th or 9th century BC) dedicated to an unknown deity. Earlier scholars, on the basis of \u2018fire-less sacrifice' to which Pindar enigmatically refers in his 7th Olympian Ode (l. 48) in connection with Lindos, assumed that the sacrifices to Athena took place at this site and not on the Acropolis. However, subsequent evidence has proven this assumption wrong; there was, in fact, a sacrifical altar in front of the Temple of Athens on the Acropolis.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q65122097'>Wikidata ID: Q65122097<\/a>","name":"Lindos","modSource2":5,"placeID":"361281PLin","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":11029,"pleiades":589913,"country":"Greece","region":"Dodecanese","dept":"Rodos","2011LG":"Rodou","1997LG":"Lindion","pre97":"Lindou","mod":"Lindos","works":42,"regionKML":"Dodecanese3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039b\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Lindos (Dodecanese)","greek2":"\u039b\u1f77\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2362022,"PHIsearch":"\u039b\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/589913","webPageData":22848,"work_id":2,"placeid":223,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.057900000000000062527760746888816356658935546875,36.221800000000001773514668457210063934326171875]},"properties":{"pk":226,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":5,"priority":5,"ModSource":5,"latitude":36.221800000000001773514668457210063934326171875,"longitude":23.057900000000000062527760746888816356658935546875,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u03a3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 - Skandeia, Classical to Roman coastal settlement near Palaiopoli on Kythera","concat2":"Skandeia (Kythera) 5 Palaiopoli - \u03a3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"The coast-road leads back, west from Avl\u00e9monas, to Palaiopolis.

A glance at the map of Greece reveals why Kythera has had an enduring importance throughout history: it is the first refuge for ships heading into the eastern Mediterranean after rounding the often perilous waters off Cape Matapan, and is the obvious provisioning stop before the crossing to Crete and points further east. Kythera's most remarkable heritage lies in its numerous Byzantine remains and paintings. <br>As might be expected of an island as close to the Peloponnese as Kythera, archaeological evidence (from the southern cave of Aghia Sophia in particular) bears witness to settlement as early as the 6th millennium BC, becoming more widespread in the 4th millennium.  Kythera was already subject to Minoan settlement early in the 2nd millennium BC.  By the end of the 15th century BC the island had been abandoned by Minoan settlement, and a Mycenaean presence proliferates in its place.  The name \u201cKutira\u201d appears in a list of Aegean place-names dating from the reign of Amenhotep III (c. 1400 BC): but Aristotle remarks that, in remote antiquity, the island is said to have been called Porphyrousa (\u2018the purple one') from the abundant murex-bearing molluscs in its waters.  The Phoenicians (c.1100 BC) developed the island's purple industry and also may have introduced the worship of Syrian Aphrodite, as Herodotus suggests.  This might explain Hesiod's account of the birth of Aphrodite as occurring just by Kythera.  The island figures in the Iliad as the home of of the two Achaean warriors, Amphidamas and Lycophron: the latter was killed by Hector, the former was one of those hidden within the wooden horse.  The 5th c. BC dithyrambic poet, Philoxenos, was also born on Kythera.<br>In c. 550 BC, Sparta seized Kythera from Argos, and during the Peloponnesian War the island guarded the southern seaboard of Lacedaimonia until it was subdued by Nikias for Athens in 424 BC.  In 195 BC it was under Spartan dominion once again; but in 21 BC it was gifted to C. Iulius Eurycles by Augustus in gratitude for his support at the Battle of Actium, later being returned once more to Sparta by Hadrian. <br>Christianity may have come to the island in the person of the martyr, Aghia Elessa, in the 4th century.  Archaeological evidence suggests well-established Christian communities in the 6th century, which were later given considerable impetus by the arrival of the Blessed Theodoros in the 10th century.  After the 4th Crusade, Kythera, mostly under the control of the Venetian family of the Venieri, suffered many invasions \u2013 the worst in 1537, when the capital was destroyed and the inhabitants sold into slavery by Khaireddin Barbarossa.  The island remained a Venetian possession, however, referred to by its Italian name Cerigo, up until the dissolution of the Serene Republic in 1797, except for a brief interlude of 3 years of Turkish sovereignty, 1715-18.  In church matters, however, the Orthodox Church maintained an almost absolute dominance. <br>After 1797, briefly captured by the French, then seized by the Russians, left in anarchy, and returned by treaty again to the French, it was eventually taken by the British in 1809, who administered Kythera together with the Ionian islands until their union with Greece in 1864.  Kythera was the first piece of Greek territory to be liberated by Allied forces in September 1944. <br> It is on the hill called Palaiokastro that the probable site of the ancient sanctuary of Aphrodite, mentioned by Herodotus, is to be sought.   Pausanias, who remarks (III.23.1) that the sanctuary was the oldest place of the cult of Aphrodite in the Greek world and that the goddess here was figured fully armed, estimates that it was at a distance of 10 stades (approximately 1.8 km) from Skandeia.  The exact site has never been definitively located, even though it has attracted the attentions of great archaeologists \u2013 foremost amongst them, Heinrich Schliemann, who came here to dig in 1887 together with Valerios Sta\u00efs. (At the junction in the road just west of Palaiopolis on the coast, take the right-hand fork for Fratsia.  The road climbs and, after 3.3 km, levels out before beginning to descend a little, just as the view of the interior of the island opens before you; at this point, to the right (north), an unsigned track leads up the hill of Palaiokastro.  From this point of departure, however, Ag. Kosm\u00e1s itself is not clearly visible; by taking the asphalt road 500m further towards Fratsia and looking back, you now see the profile of the hill clearly, with the tiny church of Ag. Giorgios crowning the summit, and Ag. Kosm\u00e1s \u2013 the object of this visit \u2013 on the shoulder of the hill below and to the east.   Access is not always easy and lies partly through dense undergrowth: a stick and good boots are advisable. The walk can take 50 minutes each way from the main road.) <br>The track ends after 400m in a flat area just below a small, deserted stone house.  On the ground here is an ancient carved stone basin and well.  Beneath the dense undergrowth all around are the collapsed walls and numerous terraces of an area which was densely inhabited in antiquity, probably the acropolis of the ancient city.  Some recent archaeologists (Coldstream & Huxley, 1973) have suggested that the temple of Aphrodite was located \u2018on a terrace mid-way between Aghios Kosm\u00e1s and the chapel of Aghios Giorgios at the summit of the mountain'. This is just above where you are now standing. Aghios Kosm\u00e1s is clearly visible from here, and is best approached by continuing on the level towards the east, and striking uphill to the church at the very last moment. <br>This is a tiny, abandoned, isolated and cramped church with no external embellishment or grace whatsoever; but few churches in all of Greece give more poignant expression to the period of turmoil after the collapse of the Graeco-Roman world, when pagan temples were unheedingly pulled down and their elements used in new buildings to the new Deity.  The crude exterior of Aghios Kosm\u00e1s consists mostly of uniform rectangular blocks taken from ancient buildings, with some few truncated columns also incorporated, and supplemented with rough stone filling.  Inside, it is dark, and has the feel of a prehistoric cave.  The *interior structure of the church dates in all probability from the 6th century AD \u2013 although it has been reinforced, retouched and redecorated many times since then. The narthex appears also to have been added at a later date.  It is divided (almost as an ancient temple might be) into three successive zones, and the tiny interior space is dominated by the four supporting Doric columns and the disproportionate blocks of ancient masonry on all sides.  Schliemann found that two of these columns had not been moved from their original position, and concluded that the church had therefore been built directly over a pagan temple.  A couple of the capitals are well preserved, and these, together with the fact that the columns are monolithic, would suggest an early (Archaic) date for the temple to which they belonged.  The lintel block over the passage between the narthex-area and the central part of the church is a re-used and inverted piece of ancient architrave: on its inside (east) face, the decorative dentils are still visible.  Both long walls and the area above and between the two apses have the very eroded remains of paintings, but with their colours still quite fresh in places.  A design with two (as opposed to one or three) apses side by side at the east end is not particularly usual, and in this church it may reflect the dedication to the two Anargyri, or \u2018money-less' saints \u2013 SS. Cosmas and Damian, who travelled in Syria and in Asia Minor offering their medical services gratis.  This particular dedication may also be reflected in the presence of a long, low stone \u201cbench\u201d along the inside walls of the church: part of the early cult of these two saints involved the practice \u2013 adopted from pagan forebears \u2013 of \u2018incubation', in which the sick would sleep in the church hoping for a dream in which the saints would visit them to cure them of their infirmity.<br>At the summit of the hill of Palaiokastro is the church of Aghios Giorgios.  (There is no clear path and a visit is only for those with stamina and determination.) The whitewash of the interior of the church has flaked away to reveal only small traces of wall-painting in the conch of the apse, depicting the Virgin.  On the plateau to the west of the church, however, the foundations of a sanctuary to a female deity have been identified; and finds on the site indicate that it was frequented continuously from the 8th century BC through until Hellenistic times.    The views which the site commands are magnificent and worthy of any great, Ancient Greek acropolis.<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=4888'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11855334'>Wikidata ID: Q11855334<\/a>","name":"Kythera","modSource2":5,"placeID":"363230PKyt","timePer":"ACHR","travelogues":10760,"pleiades":570400,"country":"Greece","region":"Attica","dept":"Islands\/Kythera","2011LG":"Kythiron","1997LG":"Kythiron","pre97":"Mitaton","mod":"Paleokastro","works":52,"regionKML":"3EMed","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20140815,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03cd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1","concat1":"Cythera (Kythera)","greek2":"\u039a\u1f7b\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1","iDAIGAZ":2361979,"PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03c5\u03b8\u03b7","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/570400","webPageData":28527,"work_id":2,"placeid":236,"count":4}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[27.921199999999998908606357872486114501953125,36.33619999999999805595507496036589145660400390625]},"properties":{"pk":245,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":37,"priority":4,"ModSource":5,"latitude":36.33619999999999805595507496036589145660400390625,"longitude":27.921199999999998908606357872486114501953125,"confidence":"High","description":"\u039a\u1f71\u03bc\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 - Kamiros, Archaic to Late Antique polis, Kamiros in Rhodes Dodecanese","concat2":"Kamiros (Rhodes) 37 Kamiros - \u039a\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlement.png","modernDescr":"A turning in from the shore leads up through olives and pines, to the tranquil and beautiful site of *Ancient Kameiros or Camirus (open Apr\u2013Oct 8\u20137.30; Nov\u2013Mar 8.30\u20132.30; closed Mon). In complete contrast to Ialysos, the site here is a clear and comprehensible unity, undisturbed by overbuilding in later epochs and remarkably well preserved by the in-filling dust (which Homer accurately describes as argin\u00f3eis (\u2018chalky in colour'), Iliad, II, 656). Few other places in the Greek Islands give a more complete and unfragmented picture of the layout of a small ancient centre than Kameiros. Every part of the site is visible from every other, and the simple and integral relationships between the areas can be easily understood: the civic and commercial area at the level of the entrance; the most important religious and administrative buildings at the crown of the hill; and the residential area\u2014not banished to a suburb, but laid out between the two, in such a way as to give a sense of security to the inhabitants. One of the most interesting features of Kameiros is the city's system of storage and distribution of water, effected by a network of 1 7 4 large underground conduits. The visitor today must imagine the sound of running and splashing water at many points throughout the ancient town.<br>Named after one of the grandsons of the nymph Rhode and Helios (Pindar, Olympian VII, 69\u201376), Kameiros was the smallest of the three original, Dorian settlements on the island. Its economy was primarily agricultural, and the need to store and transport its surplus produce of oil and wine was the stimulus for a vigorous, local ceramic industry. It possessed a shallow and rather exposed harbour\u2014Mylantia\u2014on the coast below: but it may also have used the more protected port, 13km further south along the coast at modern-day Kameiros Skala. This inconvenient state of affairs may have contributed to its willingness to participate in the creation of the new city of Rhodes in 407\/8 BC, with its superb ports and commanding position for trade. Kameiros was devastated by an earthquake in 226 BC: this means that much of what is standing above ground dates from the rebuilding which followed that disaster.<br>The site Lower area The visitor enters the site at the level of the commercial and civic centre, or agor\u00e1, of the city\u2014a flat, open area artificially levelled, with a retaining wall below to the left, at the seaward extremity of the present enclosure. This space was bounded by a number of sacred buildings and by the fountain complex and public meeting-space to the south east side, against the central slope of the hill. To the right on entering is a distyle temple , oriented north\/south, with two columns re-erected, probably dedicated to Pythian Apollo. Several different coloured materials have been used in its base to pleasing effect: a yellow threshold step on the front (south) side and a course of local marble at the lowest level of the base; originally this would have provided greater contrast since the upper areas of sandstone would have been rendered in white plaster. Inside, the base for the cult statue is visible, with a sunken treasury for offerings behind and two bases for votive objects to either side of the entrance of the naos. By the northwest corner of the temple is a large 3rd century BC shrine with a statue base in its interior. Further to the west, at the edge of the excavated area, are the remains of a house of the Roman period with an interior room with apse (possibly a small nymphaeum) still preserving some bright, coloured plaster.<br>The Fountain Square is the open rectangular area to your right: spacious and partially shaded, this would have been the busy social hub of the city. It is surrounded by the bases for votive statues in Lardos marble, many of them with beautifully clear inscriptions. A number have been moved by the archaeologists and lined up along the eastern edge of the area. On the north (seaward) side are two curiosities\u2014 densely inscribed stones of grey marble sculpted in a plastic and amorphous manner as if to simulate gnarled wood. The forms are too incomplete and the inscriptions too eroded to permit any certain identification of what these unusual items signified.<br>The fountain was constructed in late Classical times. Its form must have been similar to that of the Doric fountain at Ialysos which is also Classical in date. In the fa\u00e7ade were five half-columns or pillars, with pillars at the extremities. The intervals between the half-columns or pillars were closed by stone barriers. The colonnade with its barriers and the high wall at some distance behind it formed the open reservoir of the fountain, into which fell water from spouts opened in the back wall. The water was drawn in metal vessels. Behind the open reservoir, in the area where a rectangular square was later laid out, was a second, closed, cistern for collecting water. In the early 3rd century BC the fountain was taken out of use and, in its place, an open-air sanctuary was laid out consisting of two squares which together are known as \u2018The Fountain Square'. Of the fountain, the only part which was kept was the colonnade, without its barriers, to separate the two squares of the sanctuary. The square which was laid out behind the colonnade had at its centre an altar, or base of a dedication, and entry to this area may not have been permitted to the general public. In this part of the sanctuary may have taken place the meetings of the local officials. Such usage is implied by the inscription (second half of the 1st century BC) on the sides of the half-columns of the fountain, with the names of the damiourgoi, that is the eponymous archons (officials) of Kameiros.<br>Leaving this area to the north (towards the sea), you pass through what was once a long enclosure wall with engaged columns. Beside it at a lower level are visible the bases of much earlier walls of the 5th century BC in \u2018poros' limestone. At an angle, to the right, is an exedra with an altar or statue-base centrally placed in front: this was probably another, elegant votive dedication. Behind this is a terraced area referred to as the \u2018sanc tuary of the gods', containing parallel rows of altars to the various divinities whose names are inscribed on the front: \u2018Hestia' (goddess of the hearth and home), \u2018Agathos Daimon' (good fortune), etc. The long altar on the lower level was dedicated to Helios. Directly behind this sanctuary, in the northeast corner of the site, is the later bath complex with evidence of hypocaust and plastered walls for impermeability. From here the fine spectacle of the stepped main street opens out, rising uphill to the south with houses and shops to the left and right.<br>The large residential area \u2014still only partially excavated\u2014is a pleasure to explore. The houses, as was typical of the Hellenistic period, were constructed around an open peristyle with a single, central entrance onto the street: the columns supporting the roof of the peristyle have been reerected by the archaeologists in a couple of instances. The rooms off of the courtyards were small and the spaces between houses narrow. The walls would have been mostly plastered except at the external corners which are pleasingly finished in dressed stone-work: these corners were left un-plastered since they were more subject to knocks and damage. Some houses may have had wooden balconies. A walk amongst the houses reveals stone water-jars and braziers in volcanic rock from Nisyros; fountain-bases in the centre of courtyard impluvia, paved with inlaid stones; niches for statues of divinities; cisterns, wellheads and small mill-stones for grinding. Everywhere underfoot are broken ceramic tiles (thick) and pots (thin)\u2014 even some red-glaze ware: stretches of stone water-conduits (Greek) and clay-piping (Roman) at ground level, are witness to the extensive water distribution system. Just before the steps begin, an iron grill covers the main street's drain which, though modified by the excavators, still possesses its original channel.<br>At the top of the street the broad acropolis area opens out. To the left is a small rectangular shrine, standing apart and slightly off the axis of all the other buildings, though precisely oriented east\/west. The first thing to locate at this level is the oldest element\u2014a huge *Archaic cistern (6th century BC), carefully plastered and with two well preserved flights of steps leading down into it. The capacity of this impressive construction is about 600 cubic metres of water. The duct leading water into it can be seen at the top of the eastern end of the south wall; the stone discs on the floor that look like column bases cover the exit holes, and could be moved in order to regulate the flow. The rim of the cistern is beautifully finished. It is generally supposed that this collected water from the roofs of the acropolis buildings; but its size, together with the extent of the network of conduits below, would point to there having formerly been some other and more constant source of water, which has now dried. It will be observed that the cistern is bisected by a foundation wall in yellow sandstone, constructed much later in Hellenistic times. This is because, after the earthquake of 226 BC, a Hellenistic stoa of remarkable dimensions (over 200m in length) was constructed to crown the whole width of the summit of the town. Such a stoa would consist of a colonnade in front, a wall of shop or office entrances set back under the colonnade, and a rear supporting wall. The front colonnade of this stoa was built up on the wall which bisects the cistern, and which extends further to east and west; the middle wall (i.e. the front wall of the shops\/offices) runs just behind the cistern; and the base of the rear wall is visible below the line of trees behind, divided into room units. The floor of each one of these units is punctuated by a circular well-head or cistern cap.<br>This row of large cisterns was what replaced the (by then) de-commissioned Archaic cistern. The coolness of this shady building with its wide north-facing panorama over the city and the surrounding islands must have made it an enviable place to gather, to do business, or simply to be cool and admire the view. The view in the opposite direction, to the south, is also magnificent; this would have been enjoyed by the sanctuary of the other great building which occupied this summit, the Temple of Athena Kameiras. The visible remains here of a base and enclosure wall are from the last temple on the site, built after 226 BC to replace the earlier, classical Doric temple that had been shaken down. The vestigial remains of an altar and bothros (sacred pit) are visible beyond the east end, near to the south edge of the hill.<br>Much of the site is still to be uncovered. No theatre has yet been located, nor any substantial fortification walls. Cemeteries have been extensively explored on the lateral slopes, and the magnificent finds which they have yielded are in the Museum in Rhodes. Approximately 70m below the entrance to the site as you return towards the main coast road, a track to the right permits a good view of the lower wall-terracing and of an imposing exedra\u2014possibly a nymphaeum.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1231539'>Wikidata ID: Q1231539<\/a>","name":"Kamiros","modSource2":5,"placeID":"363279PKam","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":"","pleiades":589836,"country":"Greece","region":"Dodecanese","dept":"Rodos","2011LG":"Rodou","1997LG":"Kameirou","pre97":"Salakou","mod":"Kamiros","works":21,"regionKML":"Dodecanese4","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Kamiros (Rhodes)","greek2":"\u039a\u1f71\u03bc\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2122227,"PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03c1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/589836","webPageData":22850,"work_id":2,"placeid":245,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.224399999999999266719896695576608180999755859375,36.44080000000000296722646453417837619781494140625]},"properties":{"pk":259,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":1272,"priority":1,"ModSource":1,"latitude":36.44080000000000296722646453417837619781494140625,"longitude":28.224399999999999266719896695576608180999755859375,"confidence":"High","description":"\u1fec\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 - Rhodes, Island and polis, the largest in the Dodecanese","concat2":"Rhodes (Dodecanese) 1272 Rodos - \u03a1\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"polis.png","modernDescr":"On account of its privileged position and fertile soil the island has been inhabited continuously since the Middle Neolithic period (6th millennium BC).

Its territory included some of the most fertile areas of the island and extended over all of its northern part from Soroni (west) to Archaneglos (east), and up to the northern point of the island where the new city of Rhodes was laid out in the 4th century BC. The exact site of the ancient town of Ialysos is not known with certainty, but its acropolis was on the summit of Mount Philerimos behind and to the south. The city was famous in Antiquity for the Diag\u00f3ridai, a family of oligarchs who also produced a number of Olympic victors: Diag\u00f3ras, the most famous pugilist in antiquity, won the boxing competition no fewer than three times; three of his sons and two of his grandsons were also Olympic victors. He was celebrated by Pindar in his seventh Olympian Ode, of 464 BC: the ode, which tells the story of the island's identification with Helios, is an important source of Rhodian mythology. Tribute is still paid to Diag\u00f3ras' fame: the new airport of Rhodes is also named after him.<br>A winding road (signed) climbs up from Trianda through dense pine woods to the panoramic acropolis of ancient Ialysos on the flat limestone summit of Mount Philerimos (267m). (Open Apr\u2013Oct 8.30\u20137.30; Nov\u2013Mar 8.30\u20132.30; closed Mon.) In spite of its importance in Antiquity, there is less for the modern visitor to see here than at either Lindos or Kameiros. A strange atmosphere prevails, due partly to the lifeless and over-restored mediaeval buildings which occupy much of the ancient sanctuary. On entering the enclosure, the remains of the late 4th century BC Temple of Athena Ialysia (probably built over the site of an earlier temple) are visible directly in front of the monastery buildings. The stylobate is preserved, perfectly oriented to the cardinal points, and nearby are the drums of fluted columns, some of which retain vestiges of coloured stucco. The rich finds from the ritual deposit (displayed in the Rhodes Museum) date the beginning of worship here to the 9th or 8th century BC. In the 6th century AD an Early Christian basilica with three aisles was built over the temple. Its southern apse, just southeast of the temple, encloses a cruciform baptismal pool.

Steps descend steeply for 50m, from the southern extremity of the archaeological enclosure, down to the elegant Hellenistic structure which dates from the mid 4th century BC and was reassembled in 1926 by Italian archaeologists. The colonnade is about 9m long, with the fountain tanks behind faced in marble with decorative lions' heads both on the rear wall, just above water level, and on the front: some of these were perforated and functioned as a spout. One of the antae bears a scarcely legible inscription with regulations for the use of the fountain.

From hewn blocks of a dense basaltic rock created by this volcano, the ancient inhabitants of Nisyros constructed daunting walls to protect the acropolis of their city. They are extensive and very well preserved, and they constitute one of the most impressive (and least known) ancient remains in Greece.<br>Strabo, in his account of the island (Geog. X 5.16) points out that \u2018Nisyros is said to be a fragment of Cos.' Study of the geology of the area bears this out: until a catastrophic eruption around 160,000 years ago Nisyros may well have been a part of Kos. The legend, he continues, is that Poseidon in his pursuit of Polyvotis, broke off a fragment of the island, and buried the fuming giant beneath it\u2014explaining in this way the island's habitual volcanic activity. <br>The most significant prehistoric human presence (Late Neolithic) discovered so far was on the island of Gial\u00ed, just opposite Nisyros, which had important obsidian deposits. The first written mention of Nisyros is in Homer (Iliad II.676), where it is said to have participated in the expedition of 30 ships to Troy under the leadership of the sons of Thessalos. The Dorian character of the island is apparent from Herodotus (Hist. V11. 99) who says that its inhabitants came from Epidauros. In the early 5th century it was, together with Kos and Kalymnos, under the control of Queen Artemisia of Halicarnassus; but the five ships that went with her to the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC, deserted to the Greek side according to Herodotus. After this the island joined the First Athenian League and supported Athens at the outset of the Peloponnesian War, although   it later turned to Sparta and then back again to Athens as fortunes changed. <br>In the 4th century BC Nisyros was an autonomous city state, minting its own coinage (bearing various motifs, most commonly dolphins). In 200 BC, the island became part of the Rhodian State. The Nisyrian admiral, Gnomagoras, who had fought together with the Rhodian navy against Crete, was received with honours, a golden crown and the title of \u2018Governor' on his return to the island in 153 BC. Later the island became subject to the Ptolemies and then to Rome. <br>Subject in the 7th century to the Caliphate of Syria, and in the 11th century conquered by the Selcuk Turks, Nisyros was eventually reunited with the Byzantine state in 1204, and then taken in 1312 by the Knights of St. John. <br>Four years later the vassalage of the island (together with Chalki, Alimnia and Tilos) was given by them to the Assanti family of Ischia in thanks for help they had given to the Order. In 1433 it passed to the Venetian admiral, Fantino Querini, the governor of Kos. The island's population was decimated by the attack of Sultan Mehmet II in 1457 during his campaign of subjugation of the Aegean: in 1523 the island came under full Ottoman control together with Rhodes. Although a self-liberated Nisyros momentarily participated in the Provisional Administration of Free Greece in 1823, the island remained under Ottoman control until it passed to the Italians in 1912. In common with the other neighbouring islands it was liberated by Allied forces in 1944 and was incorporated into the Greek State in 1948. Major eruptions of the volcano in 1871, 1873 and 1887, and a strong earthquake in 1953, have repeatedly wrought damage to the buildings and altered the landscape of the island.<br>A delightful climb up a stone pathway in Mandraki(starting between some houses just south of Aghia Aikaterini), winds through terraces of olives, oak, figs, almonds and flowering cactus, and brings you to the ruins of Palai\u00f3kastro in just under half an hour, passing occasional ancient relicts (marble column bases, etc.) along the route. On the plateau, the ponderous fortification walls of the acropolis* come into view\u2014unexpectedly massive and well conserved, and standing to a full height of 7m in places. <br>These are among the finest ancient walls anywhere in the Greek world. They consist of two parallel curtains of perfectly dressed blocks, with massive rock in-fill in the centre. <br>This can best be seen at the western extremity where a breach in the walls makes this method of construction visible. Solid rectangular bastions project, which served effectively to cover the areas of wall in between from attack: their external corners are meticulously drafted with admirable precision. These bastions were accessible by broad staircases in the interior, of which three are still extant. The dark, red-tinged stone is a dense basaltic andesite which, along with the granites and porphyries, is one of the hardest of all stones to work by hand. One of the quarry areas for this rock may still be seen a little way to the north of the walls. <br>A perfect horizontality of parallel courses is maintained in the exterior curtain, while the interior curtain\u2014 no less robust and well-constructed\u2014is generally more irregular and polygonal in method. This might suggest two campaigns of construction: an earlier period (early 5th century) for a single wall structure (inner wall), later reinforced as a double curtain, 50\u2013100 years after, by the addition of an outer wall and solid in-fill. It is strange that a city as apparently insignificant as Ancient Nisyros should have felt the need to defend itself with walls of such magnitude. What is visible today, however, does not constitute a complete enceinte, and it is not clear how far the walls may have extended to the north, or what protected the western side other than the natural drop of the land: if there were other extensions of walls of comparable size, their remains have very successfully vanished. <br>The monumental doorway had double doors, whose imposts, fixing-holes in the threshold and bolt-holes in the jambs are all clearly visible. Any approach was well marked by the projecting bastion opposite. A revealing 4th century BC inscription* carved on the wall prohibits the erection of any building in proximity to the exterior surface of the walls. This is to be found north of the gate at eye-level on the south-facing wall of the east bastion and on the adjacent stretch of the main, east wall, written across the corner: it reads \u2018Damosion to ch\/orion pente podes \/ apo to teiche[os]', \u2018Five feet from the walls belongs to the municipality', i.e. no building within five feet (1.5m). <br>Any such building would be considered as compromising the security of the fortifications. Inside the walls, excavations are underway in the southeast corner revealing the neat masonry and steps of an earlier building campaign. Further inside, among the trees, are the remains of the Early Christian basilica of Aghios Ioannis. A half-buried row of white marble columns from the nave (some with fine crosses carved on them, similar to the columns reused in the church of Aghios Ioannis Prodromos in Mandr\u00e1ki, see above) are being brought to light by excavation, as well as a number of fine Byzantine Corinthian capitals.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38282168'>Wikidata ID: Q38282168<\/a>","name":"Nisyros","modSource2":5,"placeID":"366272PNis","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":11747,"pleiades":599829,"country":"Greece","region":"Dodecanese","dept":"Kos\/Nisyros","2011LG":"Nisyrou","1997LG":"Nisyrou","pre97":"Mandrakiou (Nisos Nisyros)","mod":"Mandraki","works":18,"regionKML":"Dodecanese3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039d\u03af\u03c3\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Nisyros (Dodecanese)","greek2":"\u039d\u1f77\u03c3\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2362153,"PHIsearch":"\u039d\u03b9\u03c3\u03c5\u03c1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/599829","webPageData":29016,"work_id":2,"placeid":288,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[27.837399999999998811972545809112489223480224609375,36.61280000000000001136868377216160297393798828125]},"properties":{"pk":289,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":24,"priority":4,"ModSource":5,"latitude":36.61280000000000001136868377216160297393798828125,"longitude":27.837399999999998811972545809112489223480224609375,"confidence":"High","description":"\u03a3\u1f7b\u03bc\u03b7 - Syme, island polis with Archaic to Roman remains, the modern Symi on Symi, Dodecanese","concat2":"Syme (Dodecanese) 24 Symi - \u03a3\u03cd\u03bc\u03b7","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlement.png","modernDescr":"Symi's mythological origins are variously and conflictingly told by different writers\u2014 Diodorus Siculus, Pliny, Eustathius of Thessalonica. It appears that the island cherished a connection with Glaucus whose particular skills associated him with the island's trades\u2014he was a fisherman, sailor and boatwright, and is said to have helped build Jason's ship, the Argo. Born mortal, he later became a deity; he abducted Syme, the daughter of king Ialysos of Rhodes, and brought her to the island, endowing it with her name. Ancient Syme contributed three ships to the Greek fleet at Troy according to Homer, who says the delegation was captained by the island's young prince, Nireus, who was\u2014after Achilles\u2014the most beautiful warrior amongst the Greeks. Homer relates that he was killed at Troy. Three ships constituted a substantial contingent for a small community which is hardly heard of otherwise in Antiquity and appears never to have minted its own coins. In the Early Bronze Age (3rd millennium BC) archaeological finds set Symi within the cultural sphere of the southeast Aegean; strong Minoan influences appear at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age (16th cent. BC). Symi's mention in the Iliad connects her to Mycenaean Greece, although finds dating from this period have so far been scant. According to ancient sources Symi was colonized (perhaps in the 10th-9th cent. BC) by Dorians, from Argos and Laconia in the Peloponnese, and subsequently from Rhodes and Cnidos. Although the island appears in Athenian tribute lists of 434\/3, most of its ancient history from 400 BC onwards is as a dominion of Rhodes. <br>In Roman and Byzantine times the fate of the island is closely bound with that of Rhodes. Symi appears early on to have begun providing Byzantium with fast ships and good sailors, a service they continued for the Knights of St John after they took the island in 1309. Two Ottoman attacks were successfully repelled in 1457 and 1485; but in 1522, perceiving the futility of further resistance, the island negotiated an agreement with the Turks which guaranteed important concessions of self-governance and free trading. These arrangements ushered in a period of stability and prosperity for the island, in which its sponge-fishing, boatbuilding and trading all flourished. Theological and Religious painting schools of wide repute were established on the island in the 18th century: their best known respresentative is the painter Gregory of Symi who worked here, as well as on Tilos and Rhodes. In 1821 Symi revolted and joined with the temporary administration of Independent Greece; but, when in 1830 it was taken under Turkish administration again, its ancient freedoms were severely curtailed. In 1912 the Italians took possession of the Dodecanese from the Turks: Symi's reliance on the fertile lands she held in Asia Minor was cut, her trade collapsed and population declined. In the Second World War the island changed hands several times. In May 1945 the German surrender of all the Dodecanese Islands was signed on the waterfront at Symi, and, after a brief period of British military rule, in March 1948 Symi joined the Greek State.<br>the Castle of the Knights of St John incorporates a bastion in (massive, but irregular) 5th century BC masonry from the ancient acropolis of Syme, on which once stood a Temple to Athena; abutting it to the left is a semicircular redoubt built by the Knights and bearing the arms of Pierre d'Aubusson as well as the date 1507 which was, in fact, four years after d'Aubusson's death. There are two further redoubts which face east and northeast. These are all later fortifications to the earlier castle of 1407 which remarkably withstood a siege by Mehmet the Conqueror in 1457. On the summit stands the church of the Panaghia tou Kastrou (the \u2018Greater'\u2014so as to distinguish it from the \u2018Lesser' below): this church was originally dedicated to Aghios Georghios, but it took the name of the original Panaghia church to the south after that was destroyed by German forces in 1944. To right and left of the entrance door are Hospitaller escutcheons in stone, taken from the walls of the castle. Inside the church is the renowned and beautiful icon of the Second Coming by the late 16th century Cretan artist, Georghios Klontzas. To one side of the church's belfry hangs an anomalous bell made from the nose of an enemy bomb.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q429430'>Wikidata ID: Q429430<\/a>","name":"Syme","modSource2":5,"placeID":"366278PSym","timePer":"ACHR","travelogues":12746,"pleiades":599950,"country":"Greece","region":"Dodecanese","dept":"Rodos\/Symi","2011LG":"Symis","1997LG":"Symis","pre97":"Symis","mod":"Symi","works":14,"regionKML":"Dodecanese3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20141003,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a3\u03cd\u03bc\u03b7","concat1":"Syme (Dodecanese)","greek2":"\u03a3\u1f7b\u03bc\u03b7","iDAIGAZ":2362478,"PHIsearch":"\u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b7","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/599950","webPageData":30797,"work_id":2,"placeid":289,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.3847999999999984765963745303452014923095703125,36.7051000000000016143530956469476222991943359375]},"properties":{"pk":297,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":11,"priority":5,"ModSource":12,"latitude":36.7051000000000016143530956469476222991943359375,"longitude":22.3847999999999984765963745303452014923095703125,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u039f\u1f34\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 - Oitylos, Archaic to Roman settlement, modern Oitylos (Vitylos) in Lakonia Peloponnese","concat2":"Oitylos (Lakonia) 11 Oitylos - \u039f\u03af\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q59530747'>Wikidata ID: Q59530747<\/a>","name":"Oitylos","modSource2":12,"placeID":"367224UOit","timePer":"ACHR","travelogues":11857,"pleiades":570527,"country":"Greece","region":"Peloponnese","dept":"Lakonia","2011LG":"Anatolikis Manis","1997LG":"Oitylou","pre97":"Oitylou","mod":"Oitylos","works":5,"regionKML":"PelopSE4","styleID":"SettlementLow","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039f\u03af\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Oitylos (Lakonia)","greek2":"\u039f\u1f34\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u039f\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/570527","webPageData":31027,"work_id":2,"placeid":297,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.498200000000000642330633127130568027496337890625,36.7254999999999967030817060731351375579833984375]},"properties":{"pk":299,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":15,"priority":4,"ModSource":4,"latitude":36.7254999999999967030817060731351375579833984375,"longitude":22.498200000000000642330633127130568027496337890625,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u039b\u1fb6\u03c2 - Las, Archaic to Roman polis near Passavas in Lakonia Peloponnese","concat2":"Las (Lakonia) 15 Passavas - \u039b\u03ac\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"Town mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Il. 2.585).

Much of it was uncovered by the demolition work done after the destruction of the 1933 earthquake. Other parts have come to light as building plots have been cleared at different points in the town. Its central focus was a low acropolis which corresponds to the hill of the \u2018Seraglio' area and the Plate\u00eda Diag\u00f3ras of today. This small, raised area was inhabited from before 2000 BC onwards, through the late Bronze Age and Geometric periods, and formed the nucleus of the Archaic and Classical town, known as Cos Meropis, in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. Then in 366 BC, Cos Meropis, together other ancient settlements on the island, formed a synoecism\u2014namely they pooled their resources to found a new and greater city, centred around the natural harbour which is today's port of Kos. This prosperous Hellenistic creation spread out all around the acropolis hill and completely filled the area between it and the harbour. <br>After Mycenaean occupation, the island was colonised, according to Herodotus (Hist. V11. 99), by Dorian settlers from Epidaurus and later belonged to the Dorian Hexapolis (with Halicarnassus, Cnidos, and the three early cities on Rhodes). Homer mentions Cos's participation at Troy in the Catalogue of Ships. Proximity to the mainland of Asia Minor, meant that it was easily subjected to the Lygdamid rulers of Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum) in the 6th c. BC; and, at the battle of Salamis in 480 BC, Cos fought for Persia under the command of Queen Artemisia of Halicarnassus, later defecting in 478\/7 BC to become an ally of Athens, with whom it participated in the expedition to Sicily during the Peloponnesian War. At the outset of that war, Cos was devastated by an earthquake in 412 BC and, in this vulnerable condition, was subsequently twice sacked\u2014first in 411 BC by Spartan forces, and then in 410 by the Athenian, Alcibiades, who later fortified and garrisoned the acropolis of Cos Meropis; archaeological evidence of this endeavour has recently been found. Against this grim backdrop, the 5th century saw nonetheless the flourishing of intellectual activity on the island, following the teachings and founding of the medical school of Hippocrates. Cos minted its own silver coinage, generally bearing the image of a crab, the island's emblem, on the reverse. <br>In 366 BC, the island, which had been previously organised in separate cities, united (in similar fashion to the synoecism on Rhodes of 408\u20137 BC), to form a single city-state, with a new, fortified capital and port founded on the northeast coast, on the site of the modern city of Kos. Its prosperity and beautiful appearance was commented on both by Diodorus Siculus (Bibl. XV 76.2) and Strabo (Geog. XIV.2.19). The fame of its School of Medicine and Sanctuary of Asklepios spread throughout the Greek world. Apart from a brief period subject to King Mausolus of Halicarnassus, and later in 256 BC to Antigonos Gonatas, Cos remained democratic and independent, allied to the dynasty of the Ptolemies and with strong trading links to Egypt: Ptolemy II \u2018Philadelphus' was born on Cos in 309 BC. Cultural and literary links with Alexandria brought the poets, Theocritus and Herondas, to the island in the 3rd century BC: their teacher, Philitas, was a native Coan. It was the people of Cos who commissioned (c. 364 BC) a statue of Aphrodite from Praxiteles, then the most prestigious sculptor alive: when he presented them with a choice of two, one draped, the other nude, they chose the former. The city of Cnidos on the mainland opposite, the island's constant rival, then snapped up the nude Aphrodite, which soon became one of the most celebrated works of its age. The great painter, Apelles, whose Aphrodite Anadyomene adorned the Asklepieion, is said to have died on Cos in c. 308 BC. <br>Cos was loyal to Rome and was recognised in return as a civitas libera until the end of the Republic. Under Augustus it was incorporated into the province of Asia; a little later, in 53 AD, the Emperor Claudius, influenced by his personal physician, Gaius Stertinius Xenophon, who was from Cos, granted the island (fiscal) immunitas. The island was famous for its wines and dyes: it produced a kind of raw silk from which very light dresses, called Coae vestes, were made. <br>A tradition holds that St. Paul visited the island in 57 AD; and Kos was, early on, the seat of a bishop who was already sufficiently senior by 325 to have participated in the First Council of Nicaea, and thereafter in most subsequent church councils. The remains of a remarkable number of fine Early Christian churches on Kos are witness to the size and importance of its Christian community. <br>The basilicas were erected in the 5th and 6th centuries; but most were destroyed in the 7th century during Saracen incursions. The island's mediaeval name was Lango (perhaps on account of its length): it is also referred to as Stanchio (supposedly a corruption of the Greek, \u2018Stin K\u00f5') by the Italians. After 1204 the island was under Venetian control, and briefly under Genoese control in 1304, until it was ceded along with Rhodes to the Knights of St. John in 1306. Only after the fall of Rhodes in January 1523 did Kos come under Turkish rule: their name for island was \u2018Istank\u00f6y', from the Italian \u2018Stanchio.' A number of fine buildings and municipal works (aqueducts and fountains) were erected under Turkish dominion. <br>After nearly 400 years of Turkish rule, the island was taken in 1912 by the Italians, who began an ambitious project of architectural embellishment as a way of asserting their presence. This was given new urgency by a catastrophic earthquake in 1933, after which a \u2018New Urban Plan' was developed; a number of important archaeological digs were begun at the same time. In 1948, Kos was united with the Greek State. The last two decades of the twentieth century have transformed the island's appearance with large-scale construction of tourist and residential buildings.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q187027'>Wikidata ID: Q187027<\/a>","name":"Kos","modSource2":5,"placeID":"369273PKos","timePer":"ACH","travelogues":10789,"pleiades":599728,"country":"Greece","region":"Dodecanese","dept":"Kos","2011LG":"Ko","1997LG":"Ko","pre97":"Ko","mod":"Kos","works":86,"regionKML":"Dodecanese3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03ce\u03c2","concat1":"Kos (Dodecanese)","greek2":"\u039a\u1ff6\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2361947,"PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03c9","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/599728","webPageData":22680,"work_id":2,"placeid":391,"count":3}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.041000000000000369482222595252096652984619140625,37.11200000000000187583282240666449069976806640625]},"properties":{"pk":406,"Z_ENT":1501,"Z":"","hits":16,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":37.11200000000000187583282240666449069976806640625,"longitude":22.041000000000000369482222595252096652984619140625,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u1f0c\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 - Antheia?, Homeric town possibly on site of Thouria, in Messenia Peloponnese","concat2":"Antheia?

From the Archaic until the Roman period it was the second in importance political and religious centre of Sparta. The most important Spartan festival, the Hyakinthia, which took place at Amyklaion, symbolises the political reconciliation of Doric Sparta (Apollo) with the Achaian population of Amyklai (Hyakinthos). <br>The sanctuary was excavated in 1890 by the Greek archaeologist Chr. Tsountas. Later, excavations were carried out by A. Furtwaengler and the architect E. Fiechter (1904), by A. Skias and E. Fiechter (1907), and by E. Buschor with W. von Massov (1925). Many architectural parts from the 'Throne' of Bathykles were recognised and published by Prof. A. Delivorrias, in 1968.<br>The most important monuments on the hill of Hagia Kyriake at Amyklai are: <br>The Acropolis of Amyklai and the Temenos of the Sanctuary of Apollo and Hyakinthos.

Stoa-like building or altar, which surrounded on three sides the colossal column-shaped statue of the god. It was decorated with relief representations and plastic compositions. The tomb-altar of the local god or hero Hyakinthos was used as the pedestal of the statue. Architectural parts of a composite style, both Doric and Ionic, are exhibited in the Sparta Museum.

The temple, which was constructed on the plans of the architect Vathykles from Magnesia, had its interior decorated with bronze sheets. <br>The ancient theatre of Sparta at the south side of the acropolis, is dated to the Early Imperial period. It preserves the orchestra, the retaining walls of the cavea with inscriptions of the rulers of Sparta during Roman times and part of the cavea of the large theatre. The scene was used to be wheeled in metal bars fixed to the ground. <br>The so-called circular building of unknown use was built with carefully worked blocks and smaller stones. In Roman time it was repaired and took the form that preserves until today.

The archaeological site at Kato Samiko, north of Lake Kaiafa, has been tentatively identified as the ancient city that was successively named Macistus, Arene, and, finally, Samia, or Samikon, or Samos. Its strategic location controlled both the fertile plain of Samiko and the road connecting Pisatis with Triphylia and western Messenia. The city had two citadels: the prehistoric acropolis on the rocky crag of Kleidi and the Classical acropolis to its east.<br> <br>Cyclopean walls protected the prehistoric acropolis, whose remains date from the Middle Helladic and Late Helladic periods. A large cemetery of Middle Helladic tumuli and a tumulus with many graves and a wealth of important grave gifts of the Middle Helladic - Late Helladic III periods were discovered in this area. Late Helladic III pottery was also found on the Classical acropolis, where a guard-tower for the prehistoric settlement at Kleidi was probably located. <br> <br>The Classical acropolis is located on Elliniko hill, on the west slopes of the Lapitha mountain range. Part of the lower city probably stretched northwest of the acropolis, in the area of Lake Agoulinitsa, which is now drained. Moveable archaeological finds date the site's occupation from the fourth century BC until the Roman period. By Strabo's time, the fourth-century fortification walls, known under the name of 'Samikon', were the city's only standing structure. The site can also be identified as ancient Macistus, which, according to Herodotus, was part of the Dorian Hexapolis founded by the Minyans in Elis Triphylia. Herodotus mentions the Samian Poseidion, a sacred wood dedicated to Poseidon, which archaeologists have looked for on the beach. In Strabo's day, it was the citizens of Macistus who tended the Samian Poseidion. <br>A Roman bathhouse and an Early Christian church are located north of the Classical acropolis. Medieval remains suggest that Kleidi was fortified during the Middle Ages, probably because of its strategic location.<br>The archaeological site at Kato Samiko comprises the prehistoric acropolis at Kleidi and the acropolis of the historical period at Elliniko, east of Kleidi, on the west slopes of Mount Lapitha. The former can be tentatively identified as the Homeric city of Arene and the latter as Samia, Samikon, or Samos. <br> <br>The rocky hill of Kleidi controlled the north-south maritime and land routes. Cyclopean walls surround the prehistoric acropolis and extend all the way across to the hill opposite, where the Classical acropolis was later established. This second hill was also occupied in prehistoric times by a possible tower or guard-post. Middle and Late Helladic pottery and the remains of a Mycenaean building were identified on the prehistoric acropolis, whereas a tumulus with multiple burials and important finds dating from the Middle Helladic until the Late Mycenaean period was excavated northeast of Kleidi. A large cemetery of the end of the Middle Helladic period, with cist-graves and one tholos tomb, all covered by tumuli, was revealed at the hill's east foot.<br> <br>The strategically located, naturally fortified hill of Elliniko oversees the only passage from Elis into Messenia and lies close to the low fertile valleys in the north and northeast. The trapezoidal enceinte, which surrounded the hill's highest terraces, is preserved on the east and northeast sides to a height of five to twelve courses. Built of pseudo-polygonal masonry, it had square towers and several large and smaller gates. The enceinte probably dates from the fourth century BC or the Hellenistic period, whereas the smaller inner enclosure probably dates from the sixth century BC.

A Middle Bronze Age Minoan colony (1700-1500 BC) with important architectural remains, wall-paintings and pottery, it developed into a flourishing Mycenaean settlement (1400-1100 BC), with a mighty wall reinforced with towers, and houses of megaron plan, to the S of the temple of Athena. A Mycenaean cemetery at neighbouring De\u011firmentepe (1300-1100 BC).<br\/>A coastal metropolis of the Ionian world with two harbours, nowadays silted up. According to mythological tradition Miletus was founded by Neleus, son of King Kodros of Athens, in the 11th-10th century BC. It was the home of Greek natural philosophers such as Thales of Miletus, Anaximander, Anaximenes, the historiographer Hekataios and the town-planner Hippodamos, whose rectangular grid system it follows. Impressive ruins can be seen today, primarily from the Hellenistic and Roman city that grew up after the destruction of the Archaic city by the Persians in 494 BC. An Archaic settlement on Kalabak Tepe hill, SW of the city. Defensive walls of the Archaic and Hellenistic periods. A 5th-century BC temple of Athena and a Delphinion, sanctuary of Apollo, dating from Archaic into Roman times. Agoras of Classical to Roman times, stoas, a stadium and gymnasium of the Hellenistic period, and a monumental bouleuterion complex from the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 BC). The city's theatre, which could accommodate 15,000 spectators, is the largest on the W coast of Asia Minor (4th century BC till Roman times). It acquired a multi-storey skene building in the 2nd century AD. This structure, together with the nymphaion and the famous N gate of the south agora, nowadays restored in the Pergamonmuseum, Berlin, are characteristic examples of the monumental architecture of fa\u00e7ades in the 2nd century AD. Noteworthy complexes of Roman baths inside the city (Faustina's Thermae) and outside it (Humei Tepe, 2nd century AD). A local archaeological museum.<br\/>On Cape Posideion (Monodendri) are the foundations of a marble altar to Poseidon (6th century BC).<br\/>The decline into which the city fell between the 4th and 6th centuries was interrupted during the reign of Justinian I (527-565). In 556 Miletus was promoted to an autocephalous archbishopric. The old metropolitan church (c. 500) and the baths were rebuilt, and new projects undertaken in the harbour. In the square of the bouleuterion are ruins of a large three-aisled basilica ('Megale Ekklesia'), most probably a metropolis, with baptistery and rotunda mausoleum with five conches at the E end of the S aisle. Mosaic floors and marble decoration of exceptional art (early 7th century). S of the agora, by the harbour, on the site of a sanctuary of Dionysos, are the ruins of an Early Christian three-aisled basilica, a baptistery and a bishop's palace.

Mentioned as 'lovely'; by Homer (Il. 2.607), it was formed by the synoecism of five villages at some unknown date (Strab. 8.3.2). As an ally of Sparta, Mantinea took part with 500 hoplites in the battle of Thermopylai (Hdt. 7.202), but came too late for Plataia (Hdt. 9.77). Mantinea split with Sparta in 420 (Thuc. 5.29) when interests collided, and was disbanded by Sparta in 385. After the battle of Leuktra in 371 the city was reconstituted, and was a member of the Arkadian League until 362 , at which time it returned to friendship with Sparta. In 223 Antigonos Doson destroyed the city which was then refounded under the name of Antigoneia, a name which it retained until Hadrian's time. Numerous battles took place in the vicinity (418: Thuc. 5.64-81; 362: 207: Polyb. 11.11-19). Pausanias describes the city (8.8.3-8.12), thus disproving Strabo (8.8.2), who included it among states no longer extant. <br>The 4th c. city--;the most ancient site was at Ptolis, securely identified with the hill Gourtsouli--;is located nearly in the middle of the plain, and was originally bisected by the Ophis river. Later, after Agesipolis had taken the city in 385 (Xen. Hell. 5.2.4-7) by damming the river and thus causing the sun-dried bricks of the walls to collapse, the river was diverted so as to flow around the city. The circuit of the walls, 3942 m long and roughly oval in shape, is preserved for nearly its entire extent. Originally built up in mudbrick, only the socle of the inner and outer curtain remains, at a height varying between 1-1.8 m with a width of 4.2-4.7 m. Over 100 towers (estimates vary as to the original number) are built out from the wall, and there are at least nine, and possibly ten, gates. Most of the gates are so constructed that one is forced to approach through towers into a passage between sections of the wall. Excavators have cleared the agora (85 x 150 m) with colonnades around it, and the remains of a 4th c. theater at its W end. Though rebuilt and remodeled at various times, it may well be one of the earlier Greek theaters. (W. F.

The architectural programme was completed at the end of the 4th century B.C. <br>During the Classical and the Hellenistic periods, the Agora was surrounded by porticos and buildings which can hardly be distinguished at present under the later architectural phases.<br>Amongst the most important uncovered buildings is: <br>A large hypostyle hall with sides about 32 m long and a roof held by 16 Ionic columns, while on the main side there was a porch with15 doric columns. It was built around 460 B.C. at the time when Argos adopted the Democratic regime and might have been a 'Bouleutherion'. <br>A large building, perhaps a 'palaistra', with porticoes of doric columns, was bordering the southern side of the Agora. Other excavated remains belong to the starting line of the dromos of a Stadium, a 'Tholos-Nymphaion' and a semi-circular theatrical construction which includes the basis of an older altar, perhaps from the sanctuary of Apollo Lykeus. <br>During the Roman times, many of the existing buildings were altered in shape and function, mostly into shops and fountains when, in the 2d and 3d century A.D. a general remodeling of the site took place. Later, during the 4th century A.D., a last monument of Paganism was built, an hearth surrounded by boundary steles from the enclosure (peribolos) of an 'heroon' of the Archa?c period dedicated to the 'Seven against Thebes'. <br>The invasion of the Goths, in 395-396 A.D. accelerated the destruction and the disappearance of the monuments of the Agora. The center of the city had been shifted. <br>The first to undertake excavations in the Agora was W. Volgraff, a member of the Franch Schol of Archaeology, who discovered the 'Hypostyle Hall' in 1904. The archaeological investigations were resumed in 1952 again by the French School of Archaeology and are still going on nowadays with short interruptions to allow for the study of the material, under the supervision of members of the School and specially P.

It was followed by successive settlements but their remains have been destroyed almost completely by the extensive construction arrangement of the Mycenaean age. Enough evidence survived from the settlement of the Early Bronze Age (2500-2000 B.C.) to prove the existence then of a series of apsidal houses arranged around a very huge circular building (diam. 28 m) on the summit of the hill. <br>The building of the fortification of the hill began during the 14th century B.C. and was completed at the end of the 13th century (Late Helladic IIIB period). The Cyclopaean walls which surround the Upper, Middle and Lower Citadel, have a total perimeter of approximately 750 m and a width between 4,50 and 7 m. Within the walls were planned the wall-painted palace, the remaining public spaces, the cyclopaean tunnels leading to the storehouses and the workshops. The town divided into blockhouses extended outside the walls and around the Acropolis (about 750 acres). <br>After the disintegration of the palatial system (about 1200 B.C.), the Acropolis continued to be used mostly as a cult place. The site had become deserted when Pausanias visited it during the 2d century A.D.<br>On the edge of the Argolic gulf, at a short distance from Nauplion, the Acropolis of Tiryns rises impressively on a rocky hill (16 m). <br>The archaeological investigations of the ancient Tiryns are tightly linked with the name of Heinrich Schliemann who in 1876 opened the first trenches in the Acropolis and the site outside the walls. In 1884\/5, during five months of extensive excavations, he uncovered, with his valuable assistant, W. Doepfeld, part of the Upper Citadel. Between 1905 and 1920, the investigations were resumed by the German Archaeological Institute on the Acropolis as in the wider surrounding area. At the end of the '50's, excavations in the area were undertaken under the supervision of the Ephore of Antiquities, N. Verdelis. <br>Finally, from 1967 onwards, the German Archaeological Institute returned to the site and with further extensive excavations directed by Ulf Jantzen and Klaus Kilian, the whole of the Upper and the Lower Citadel, part of the Mycenaean town in the wider area around the walls as well as part of the Cemetery of the Iron Age were uncovered. <br>The finds from the excavation of Tiryns are exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum and the Archaeological Museum of Nauplio.<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=5591'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q217379'>Wikidata ID: Q217379<\/a>","name":"Tiryns","modSource2":2,"placeID":"376228PTir","timePer":"ACH","travelogues":13315,"pleiades":570740,"country":"Greece","region":"Peloponnese","dept":"Argolida","2011LG":"Nafplieon","1997LG":"Neas Tirynthas","pre97":"Neas Tirynthos","mod":"Tirynthos","works":38,"regionKML":"PelopNE3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a4\u03af\u03c1\u03c5\u03bd\u03c2","concat1":"Tiryns (Argolid)","greek2":"\u03a4\u03af\u03c1\u03c5\u03bd\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u03a4\u03b9\u03c1\u03c5","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/570740","webPageData":22611,"work_id":2,"placeid":731,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.160199999999999675992512493394315242767333984375,37.633499999999997953636921010911464691162109375]},"properties":{"pk":738,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":243,"priority":3,"ModSource":1,"latitude":37.633499999999997953636921010911464691162109375,"longitude":23.160199999999999675992512493394315242767333984375,"confidence":"High","description":"\u1f18\u03c0\u1f77\u03b4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 - Epidauros, Archaic to Roman coastal polis at Archaia Epidauros in Argolid Peloponnese","concat2":"Epidauros (Argolid) 243 Archaia Epidauros - \u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"polis.png","modernDescr":"The ancient city of Epidaurus was the port of the Epidaurian chora (territory) towards the Aegean.

Its name was given to one of the greatest civilizations of Greek prehistory, the Mycenaean civilization, while the myths related to its history have inspired poets and writers over many centuries, from the Homeric epics and the great tragedies of the Classical period to contemporary literary and artistic creation. Perseus, son of Zeus and Dana?, daughter of Akrisios, king of Argos and descendant of Danaos, is traditionally considered as its mythical founder. Pausanias (2, 16, 3) reports that Perseus named the new city Mycenae after the pommel (mykes) of his sword, which fell there, or after the Perseia spring, discovered there under the root of a mushroom (mykes). According to the myth, Perseus's descendants reigned at Mycenae for three generations. After the last of them, Eurystheas, died childless, the Mycenaeans chose Atreus, son of Pelops, father of Agamemnon and Menelaos, as their king. <br>Mycenae was founded between two tall conical hills, Profitis Ilias (805 m.) and Sara (660 m.), on a low plateau dominating the Argive plain and controlling both the land and sea routes. The site was first occupied in the seventh millennium BC (Neolithic period). Very little remains of this early settlement because of continuous re-occupation up until the historical period. Most of the monuments visible today were erected in the Late Bronze Age, between 1350 and 1200 BC, when the site was at its peak. In the early second millennium BC a small settlement existed on the hill and a cemetery with simple burials on its southwest slope. Grave Circle B, a stone-built funerary enclosure containing monumental graves with rich grave gifts, indicates that the first families of rulers and aristocrats appeared at Mycenae at approximately 1700 BC. This social structure developed further in the early Mycenaean period, c. 1600 BC, when a large central building, a second funerary enclosure (Grave Circle A) and the first tholos tombs were erected on the hill. The finds from these monuments show that the powerful Mycenaean rulers participated in a complex network of commercial exchange with other parts of the Mediterranean. <br>The construction of the palace and fortification wall currently visible began c. 1350 BC (Late Helladic IIIA2). The latter saw three construction phases, the first wall being built of Cyclopean masonry. A new wall was erected to the west and south of the early one approximately one hundred years later (Late Helladic IIIB1), together with the Lion Gate, the citadel's monumental entrance, and its bastion. Included in the newly fortified area were the city's religious centre and Grave Circle A, which was refurbished and used for ancestral cults. The famous tholos tomb known as the 'Treasure of Atreus', with its gigantic lintels and tall beehive vault, was probably built during the same period. At approximately 1200 BC, in the Late Helladic IIIB-C period, following a large destruction probably caused by an earthquake, the walls were extended to the northeast so as to include the subterranean well. Successive destructions and fires led to the site's final abandonment c. 1100 BC. <br>After the collapse of the palatial system and of the 'Mycenaean Koine', the hill was sparsely inhabited until the Classical period. Meanwhile, several local cults of heroes developed in the area, fuelled by Mycenae's fame, which the Homeric poems spread throughout Greece. A temple dedicated to Hera or Athena was erected on the top of the hill in the Archaic period. In 468 BC, after the Persian Wars, in which Mycenae took part, the town was conquered by Argos and had part of its fortification wall destroyed. In the Hellenistic period, the Argives founded a 'village' on the hill, repaired the prehistoric walls and the Archaic temple, and erected a small theatre over the dromos of the tholos tomb of Clytaemnestra. The town was abandoned in subsequent centuries and was already in ruins when Pausanias visited it in the second century AD. <br>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the impressive Cyclopean walls of the Mycenaean acropolis attracted many travellers and antiquaries who did not hesitate to loot the site, taking advantage of the indifference and greed of the Turkish authorities. In 1837, after the Greek Independence, the archaeological site of Mycenae came under the jurisdiction of the Greek Archaeological Society, whose representative K. Pittakis cleared the Lion Gate in 1841. In 1876, after opening several small test trenches in 1874, Heinrich Schliemann began excavating Grave Circle A, where he uncovered five graves. His work was continued in 1876-1877 by trench supervisor P. Stamatakis who uncovered the sixth grave. In subsequent years C. Tsountas (1884-1902), D. Evangelidis (1909), G. Rosenwaldt (1911), A. Keramopoulos (1917) and A. J. B. Wace (1920-1923, 1939, 1950-1957) excavated the palace and cemeteries. In 1952-1955 I. Papadimitriou and G. Mylonas of the Greek Archaeological Society excavated Grave Circle B and several houses, while G. Mylonas with N. Verdelis of the Archaeological Service excavated parts of the settlement. Excavations by the British School at Athens under Lord W. Taylor uncovered the religious centre, while further investigations were conducted by the Greek Archaeological Society under G. Mylonas and S. Iakovidis in 1959 and 1969-1974. In 1950-1955 A. Orlandos and E. Stikas supervised the restoration of the Tomb of Clytaemnestra, the palace, Grave Circle B and the area surrounding the Lion Gate. The project for the 'Restoration-Conservation-Presentation of the Monuments of the Acropolis of Mycenae and its Greater Area', begun in 1998, was overseen initially by the Work Group for the Restoration of the Monuments of Epidaurus and subsequently by the Mycenae Committee, created in 1999.<br>The archaeological site of Mycenae comprises the fortified acropolis and surrounding funerary and habitation sites, which are located mainly to its west and southwest. Most of the visible monuments date to the centre's great floruit, from 1350 to 1200 BC. <br>Great Cyclopean walls surround the almost triangular acropolis, which is accessed from the northwest through the famous Lion Gate, the symbol of the Mycenaean rulers' power. The gate was named after the two opposing lions carved in relief and set into the relieving triangle, a typical feature of Mycenaean architecture, over the door. To the right of the Lion Gate are the remains of a building dubbed the 'Granary', because its basement contained carbonized grain. South of the Granary is Grave Circle A, whose six large shaft graves contained numerous gold objects and other works of art. Beyond this is a series of buildings, possibly the residences of high officials: the House of the Warrior Krater, the Ramp House, the South House and the Citadel House. The citadel's religious centre, along the south fortification wall, includes the Temple of the Idols, the House of the Frescoes, Tsountas's House and the Priest's House. A staircase and a large processional street connected these shrines to the palace. <br>The palace, symbol of the power of Mycenaean rulers, dominates the citadel's highest point. It sprawls over artificial terraces and was reached by a large ramp beginning at the Lion Gate. The main palace building includes a large courtyard, a guesthouse and, at its very centre, the Mycenaean megaron. The latter consisted of three parts: a columned porch, a vestibule (prodomos) and the main chamber (domos), which housed the ruler's throne. The palace also included workshops and storerooms, both related to the palatial monopoly of goods, cult buildings and houses, which probably belonged to high officials. <br>At the northeast corner of the fortifications is the entrance to the underground spring, built during the third construction phase to safeguard access from the interior of the citadel during sieges. A corbelled corridor leads to the underground cistern located eighteen metres below, outside the fortification walls. Near the entrance to the cistern, to its west, is the citadel's second gate, the so-called North Gate, of similar construction as the Lion Gate, only smaller. <br>Outside the fortification walls, west of the Lion Gate, is Grave Circle B, which encloses fourteen shaft-graves. Four of the nine tholos tombs discovered so far at Mycenae are also located in this area. The so-called tombs of the Lions, Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra, and the Treasury of Atreus, further south, illustrate the development of this type of funerary structure, the latter being its most perfect example, with its enormous lintels, imposing vault and richly decorated fa?ade. <br>Approximately fifty metres south of Grave Circle B, next to the modern asphalt road, are the remains of four buildings, the so-called houses of the Shields, of the Oil-Merchant, of the Sphinxes and the West House. Several inscribed clay tablets discovered in the House of the Oil-Merchant mention workers, oil and perfumes. These indicate that this was probably a workshop specializing in the production of perfumes and perfumed oils, which the Mycenaeans exported. <br>Traces of the highly developed road network, which connected Mycenae with the other large centres in the area, are still preserved around the citadel. One of these roads with its bridge is visible near the cemetery of the modern village, while a second road along the northern fortification wall still shows tracks made by ancient chariot wheels.<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=4423'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q132564'>Wikidata ID: Q132564<\/a>","name":"Mycenae","modSource2":2,"placeID":"377228PMyk","timePer":"LACHR","travelogues":11512,"pleiades":570491,"country":"Greece","region":"Peloponnese","dept":"Argolida","2011LG":"Argous-Mykinon","1997LG":"Mykinaion","pre97":"Mykinon","mod":"Mykines","works":66,"regionKML":"3EMed","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039c\u03c5\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9","concat1":"Mycenae (Argolid)","greek2":"\u039c\u03c5\u03ba\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u039c\u03c5\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/570491","webPageData":21929,"work_id":2,"placeid":785,"count":9}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[26.934999999999998721023075631819665431976318359375,37.69500000000000028421709430404007434844970703125]},"properties":{"pk":805,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":837,"priority":2,"ModSource":5,"latitude":37.69500000000000028421709430404007434844970703125,"longitude":26.934999999999998721023075631819665431976318359375,"confidence":"High","description":"\u03a3\u1f71\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 - Samos, important island polis, the modern Pythagoreion on Samos, Aegean","concat2":"Samos (Aegean) 837 Pythagoreio - \u03a3\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"polis.png","modernDescr":"There were, in ancient times, two natural harbour-inlets at the far eastern end of the plain, one where the modern port of Pythag\u00f3reio is, the other\u2014now a small lake called Glyphada\u2014 lies a little to its west (beside the Doryssa Bay Hotel). Between the two was a hill, usable as a low acropolis. There were several strong, fresh-water springs in the area, the most important at Aghiades, to the north of the area, and at Myli, to the west. In short: all the prerequisites for a successful urban settlement. On the low hill between the two ancient harbours, where the castle of Lycourgos Logothetis now stands in Pythag\u00f3reio, was a Late Neolithic settlement of the 4th millennium BC, whose finds show affinities with contemporaneous Cycladic culture. This hill later became the earliest acropolis and nucleus of the subsequent settlement of historic times.<br\/>The low hill to the west of the port, referred to in Antiquity as Astypalaia and today known as \u2018Kastro', served as an acropolis for the early city, and may have become traditionally the seat of later rulers' and governors' palaces. Today it is crowned by a restored Byzantine castle; the visible ancient ruins here are from the last phases of the site's development in Antiquity. These lie within the circuit of the castle walls, to the east of the modern church of the Metamorphosis; they comprise the foundations of two patrician, Hellenistic villas of the 2nd century BC, which appear to have been modified substantially in the course of the 1st century AD and united into one large Roman villa, looking south out to sea and north across the city. <br>The wealth and importance of the building are clear not only from the number of portrait busts and statues of the Imperial families found at this site, but also from the rich polychrome marbles used for decoration\u2014especially the two exquisite, broken columns of *Iasos Jasper, framing an entrance of the north peristyle; other columns in Euboean \u2018Cipollino' marble can be seen to the east. The villa comprises a series of colonnaded courts. Water, as often with Hellenistic and Roman villas, was an important feature: the peristyle court closest to the sea has a complex of water channels within its perimeter, and there is a cistern below an impluvium to east of the centre of the area. Samos was a favoured resort by the early Roman Imperial families, many of whom may have stayed here. Antony and Cleopatra are said to have chosen to honeymoon on Samos, perhaps in a conscious and propagandistic emulation of Zeus and Hera whose nuptials were celebrated on the island. Superimposed on the centre of the area are the roughstone walls of a small, apsed, 5th century, Early Christian church, whose entrance through the north side of its narthex is marked by a monolithic threshold of dark stone (cf. Aghios Ioannis at Melits\u00e1cha on Kalymnos); elements of its decorated stonework lie around. At the northern end of the site, sections of the Hellenistic walls are clearly visible; spolia from a temple-building of large dimensions are to be seen all around the site.<br>The largest and richest city of the Aegean in the 6th century BC, Samos was still able deeply to impress Herodotus when he visited 100 years later. On his own admission, he digressed at great length about Samian history in his writings, partly because he was so amazed by what he referred to as \u2018three of the greatest building and engineering marvels in the Greek world' (Hist. III. 60), which he was shown during his visit. The modern harbour of Pythag\u00f3reio (c. 36,000 sq. m) is considerably smaller in area than the ancient port (c. 66,000 sq. m), owing to subsequent silting and sedimentation on the north and west sides. The original harbour walls on these two sides can be traced today, some way inland of the present water-front. In Antiquity, the wealth of any city in the Greek islands depended on its ability to manage or dominate sea-trade. Samos had a larger fleet of military and commercial ships than any island city, even Aegina, in the 6th century, and it needed to house them and protect them from the frequent and destructive south winds. Herodotus mentions \u2018boat-sheds' at Samos (III. 45), and these were probably built by Polycrates in the decade between 535 and 525 BC during the same period in which he upgraded the port. But what caught the historian's attention most was the long artificial protecting mole, which ran out to sea across the south side of the harbour, for almost half of a kilometre from its back (west) wall, into a depth - he claims - of 20 fathoms of water. Laying foundations at such a depth, and building securely on top of them underwater, was an extraordinary feat for those times. It must have been the first example of an endeavour of this kind, on such a scale, and like the first colossal temple of Hera, it was a clear change in thinking from anything that preceded it. The present-day mole dating from 1862, where the ferries dock, is of considerable length; but the Polycratean one was longer and began from further west. It now lies under water, further south out to sea: it is a stone structure made of rubble and re-used architectural material, running for 480m. Only its base exists today, submerged at a depth of 3m near the shore, and at almost 14m at its eastern end, where it begins to turn north and goes beneath the modern mole shortly before its eastern terminus. <br>In addition, underneath the present north mole of the harbour (which runs north\u2013south), lies a further 6th century BC structure: this was an extension of the land fortifications, and closed the harbour to the east. It is estimated it was about 175m long and 20m wide. <br>Today's breakwater, enlarged and extended in 1862, would seem to be based on a later (and less ambitious) Hellenistic mole. A 30m stretch of its neatly cut masonry, with compact surface and finely-edged borders and paving, is preserved in the space between the taverna, V\u00e1rka, and the houses that front the west of the present harbour. <br>From this point it is possible to follow the projection of its line west for over 150m, past elements of it which are incorporated into recent buildings along the way, until it becomes no more than a cut line in the bedrock towards the end. It terminates in the base of a bastion to the west, where there is a deep hole, as big as a small gateway, cut down through the rock below. Interestingly, Herodotus mentions a secret passageway, leading from the citadel to the sea, in Book III, 147, of his Histories. From here the line of the west harbour walls runs inland to the north, parts of which are visible as far as Kanaris Street, beside the Stratos Hotel, in the third block back from the waterfront. Tracing these lines gives a vivid sense of the much greater area of the Archaic harbour by comparison with today's much smaller port. <br>At many points\u2014especially on the mountain behind the town\u2014these fortifications are clearly visible and traceable for much of their total length of 6.4km. Only the southern sea-walls are not in evidence. Two distinct campaigns can be distinguished: 1. the earliest walls, erected probably in the 530s BC under Polycrates's rule, were constructed at the lower levels in polygonal limestone blocks, and then raised above that level in fired brick and mud; they had few bastions, and mostly arched or corbelled gateways. Some of the stone for the western arm will have been provided by the contemporaneous excavation of the tunnel of Eupalinos; but most of it was obtained from the escarpments to the west of the Panaghia Spilian\u00ed, where evidence of ancient quarries can still be seen. The defeat of Samos in 439 BC by the Athenians under Pericles led to the forced dismantling of this enceinte under the terms of the armistice. <br>2. the Hellenistic walls, reconstructed using the foundations of the earlier walls, were built again around 300 BC, under the auspices of Demetrius \u2018Poliorcetes' (the \u2018Besieger of Cities'), this time in isodomic masonry composed of large rectangular blocks, often as much as 1.5m long. The enceinte was now endowed with over 30 towers or bastions (some square and some polygonal in section), which protected massive lintel-and-post gateways, which still preserve the deep slots for fixing the gates. In places these walls were later repaired during the 2nd century BC. Long sections of the enceinte can be walked\u2014along the east, north and west sides over the hill behind the city.  <br>The two periods of walls and gates can be clearly seen and compared in the eastern sector above the port (reached by taking the left turn for Mytilini\u00ed, one kilometre out of Pythag\u00f3reio, and continuing uphill for 400m until the road returns west to the line of walls). At the summit of the hill and down the western side (reached from opposite the Doryssa Bay Hotel) the Hellenistic work is relatively wellpreserved and displays more clearly the method of its construction: two parallel walls of massive isodomic masonry 3m apart, with stone and rubble in-filling. In the lowest reaches of the western wall, just above the old secondary port of Glyphada, which has now silted up and become an enclosed lake, a rock-cut ditch about 3\u20134m wide runs parallel to the walls 5m to their west (outside); this was left by the quarrying of the stone for the walls, and may have served coincidentally a defensive purpose thereafter. <br>Most impressive of all is the well-preserved 4th century BC watch-tower in the northwest corner which stands to a height of over 10m, with the apertures and precisely drafted corners typical of Hellenistic construction. <br\/>Three blocks in from the centre of the harbour front, and one block north of the main street, on Eupalinou Street, is a corner of the crepis and fragments of some of the fluted columns of the 4th century BC Temple of Dionysos. This has been identified from inscriptions which honour the Emperor Claudius for restructuring the temple after damage wrought by earthquakes in 47 AD. Continuing west along the main street, towards the junction with the road north to Vath\u00fd, you approach the area of the ancient agor\u00e1 of the city. To the south of the street, by the junction, are the remains of what is referred to as the Temple of Aphrodite, which would have stood in a small courtyard bounded by stoas on three or four sides: the stone base of the colonnade (with visible insets for the columns) of the west stoa can be seen, facing the rear steps of the temple's platform at a distance of 5m; behind it are the lower courses of its back wall. The cult of Aphrodite is attested in this area by votive finds from as far back as the 6th century BC, but the temple whose base is visible today is a Roman construction. There is growing evidence that the Archaic Temple of Aphrodite is being uncovered in excavations just to the north of the main road here; this Roman building, therefore, may be a 1st century temple of Augustus and Roma, which is mentioned in epigraphic sources.<br>Fifty metres further west along the road and to the north, behind a first row of buildings, lies what has been uncovered so far of the ancient agor\u00e1, which would have extended further to the east. The visible remains are mostly of Roman date: a couple of unpolished column fragments in the grey and pink \u2018Africano' marble from Teos, on the Asia Minor coast opposite Chios, give an intimation of the colourfulness of some of the buildings which faced the square of the agor\u00e1. A little further along the main road on the same side, and covered by a provisional roof for protection, is a nymphaeum. On the mountainside directly above can be seen the Cave of Spilian\u00ed, which was the principle Samian home in Antiquity of the cult of the Nymphs. The Nymphaeum here was probably a subsidiary shrine combined with a water fountain\u2014a deep pool, with a hemicycle to the west, faced with sheets of marble, into which a flight of steps descends. <br>Much of the water from the aqueduct would ultimately have been destined for the area of an extensive \u2018sports complex', which occupies a long stretch to the south of the road west of the nymphaeum, in the low-lying land between the Sacred Way and the shore. In this area, the few remaining inhabited houses all incorporate spolia and ancient fragments. The gymnasia, a xystos (covered exercise area) and the stadium, appear to have been laid out in the 4th century BC, in the same period that the Hellenistic walls were being built; little remains to be seen on the ground today, except some of the steps of the perimeter colonnade which enclosed the complex, close to the road, and the starting-grid, or \u00e1phesis, at the western end of the stadium which lay in the south of the area and ran parallel to the shore. In between the two peristyle courts for sports practice, the massive block of the well-preserved thermal baths (open daily except Mondays, 8.30\u20133) were added substantially later. The baths are constructed from a wide variety of building materials\u2014large, clean-cut blocks of stone from preexisting Hellenistic structures, rubble stone walls, mortar, and brick-tiles; originally, this would all have been covered by a revetment in marble or plaster on the interior surfaces. The complex dates from Imperial Roman times, probably the late 2nd century AD; but the building was adapted for Christian use in the later 5th century AD. The northern area has been given over to storing and exhibiting a variety of objects brought here from sites around the town: ancient altars, statue plinths, capitals, sarcophagus lids and some fine stone jars of a kind similar in design to those adapted for later use as water-stoups in Haghia Sophia in Istanbul.<br>To the south of this, is the area where the Early Christian churches have been constructed over the atrium and apodyteria (changing rooms) of the Roman baths: first the plan of a large, apsed structure is seen to the left; then, further in, the foundations of two smaller chapels built over the octagonal pool in the centre of the main frigidarium of the baths. Masonry still with Roman decorative mosaic applied to it is visible to the left. The calidarium, or steam-room, lies just beyond its southwest corner, where a marble-lined pool has been consecrated with a cross and turned into the baptistery of the Early Christian complex. To the south of here are a succession of three rectangular halls\u2014tepidaria\u2014running from west to east, all raised above a sophisticated hypocaust system, and with their once marble-clad walls heated through cavities within their thickness, fed with hot air from the furnaces below. The westernmost of these halls, has two immersion pools to north and south, and three along its west side. In its southwestern corner is a marble block, immured upside down, bearing an inscription in Greek, to the \u2018August Tiberius Caesar', suggesting later modification and repair to this part of the building. Further south, overlooking the shore, and running the width of the building, are the remains of the palaestra of the baths.<br>Dominating the sky-line immediately to the west are the imposing remains of a three-aisled, 5th century AD Christian basilica, sandwiched improbably between the swimming pools (west door and narthex) and recreation area (apse) of the Doryssa Bay Hotel, beneath whose foundations must lie further archaeological remains (access is free, either from the shore or through the grounds of the hotel). <br>The basilica was almost 30m in length and of considerable height, as is indicated by the three, soaring, south piers which still stand today, and which give the basilica its local name, \u2018Tria Dontia', or \u2018three teeth'. There is no clear evidence that these were mirrored on the north side, and their position outside of the south aisle suggests that they were reinforcing buttresses rather than piers from which sprang a vaulted roof. They are constructed in rough stone and faced with large blocks of Hellenistic masonry, dismantled from earlier buildings such as the Gymnasia to the east. A wide variety of different marbles\u2014Proconnesian, Samian, Iasian\u2014lie around which will probably have been taken from the adjacent Roman thermae. The high quality of masonry of the wall perpendicular to the north side of the basilica, constructed in clear-cut blocks of the 4th century BC, fastened together with bronze clips, stands out by comparison with the hastily realized, later structures above. A large, contemporaneous, covered drainage channel runs north\/south across the west side of the whole site. <br\/>To the east side of the inner lake, can be seen the well preserved isodomic masonry of the 4th century BC defensive walls. To the west is the small church of the Koimisis tis Theotokou (The Dormition), assembled from, and surrounded by, a variety of Ancient and Early Christian spolia, taken from the previous Palaeochristian church on the site, which in turn, took pieces from its pagan predecessor. This is the site of the Archaic Sanctuary of Artemis, whose temple, which had a roof supported on wooden columns, was early on destroyed by the Persians in 522 BC. Excavation trenches in the marshy area below have yielded a wealth of finds\u2014amongst them the headless kouros, with a dedicatory inscription to Apollo, now in the museum in Vath\u00fd (no. 16, mentioned above). Herodotus recounts (Hist. III. 48) how the Samians thwarted the attempt of the Corinthian tyrant Periander to send 300 boys of the nobility of Corcyra (Corfu) to Sardis to be made eunuchs, as an act of revenge against the Corcyrans: the party put in at Samos and when the Samians learned the nature of the mission, they were so appalled they confined the boys to the sacred refuge of this Sanctuary of Artemis, saved them from their Corinthian captors, and returned them later to their homes. A Sanctuary of Demeter has also been located higher up the hill, just inside the western walls. <br>To the west of the lakes of Glyph\u00e1da, were the cemeteries of Ancient Samos, used continuously from Archaic times (on the hillside further to west) through to Early Christian times (the area immediately west of the Artemision), with the Hellenistic and Roman necropolises between the two. The Early Christian cemetery is the most rewarding of these to visit. Its nucleus is a late Hellenistic rock-cut tomb. Around this, a Christian catacomb seems to have developed early on; as the Christian community grew and began to take over the metropolis, this was then developed into a large urban, cemetery building, perhaps constituting the substructure beneath a chapel above. The way in which it has evolved around an early nucleus suggests a martyrium, with the burial place of an important Early Christian figure at its centre. Two levels of burial loculi with vaulted roofs or cupolas lead off from the principal arched entrance: traces of colour (principally reds) survive from the decorated plaster of the interiors.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q13580795'>Wikidata ID: Q13580795<\/a>","name":"Samos","modSource2":5,"placeID":"377269PSam","timePer":"ACHR","travelogues":12475,"pleiades":599925,"country":"Greece","region":"North Aegean","dept":"Samos","2011LG":"Samou","1997LG":"Pythagoreiou","pre97":"Pythagoreiou","mod":"Pythagoreio","works":167,"regionKML":"2Emed","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a3\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Samos (Aegean)","greek2":"\u03a3\u1f71\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2362408,"PHIsearch":"\u03a3\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/599925","webPageData":21194,"work_id":2,"placeid":805,"count":3}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[27.08330000000000126192389870993793010711669921875,37.66669999999999873807610129006206989288330078125]},"properties":{"pk":811,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":85,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":37.66669999999999873807610129006206989288330078125,"longitude":27.08330000000000126192389870993793010711669921875,"confidence":"Medium","description":"\u039c\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 - Mykale, mountain, the modern Samsun Dag in Ionia (Aegean Turkey)","concat2":"Mykale Mt.

The site was inhabited almost continuously from the beginning of the Middle Palaeolithic (130\/120,000) until the end of the Early Byzantine period (seventh century AD), when the city was abandoned. Aetolos Oxylos is considered the city's mythical founder (twelfth-eleventh centuries BC). He allegedly took advantage of the Dorian invasion in order to subordinate the area's early inhabitants and founded the first settlement. The city thrived in the early historical period (eleventh-tenth centuries BC), during the late Archaic and early Classical periods (sixth-fifth centuries BC), and in the Early Roman period (second century BC - early third century AD).<br> <br>Large numbers of flint tools from surface layers suggest that the site was inhabited since the Palaeolithic. Habitation concentrated primarily in the area of the later theatre at the end of the Neolithic, and on the acropolis during the late third and early second millennia BC. The Mycenaean period saw the development of several settlements, whose cemeteries lie close to the limits of the later city. Several graves in the later city's agora date from the end of the Mycenaean period (mid-twelfth century BC).<br> <br>The graves at the theatre and neighbouring east cemetery date to the early historical period, the so-called Dark Age (eleventh-tenth centuries BC). The corresponding settlements were probably located nearby. The Geometric finds, which indicate the possible existence of two small temples, are limited, and there is even less evidence for the seventh century BC. By contrast, the sixth century BC was a period of development witnessed by the finds from temples and public buildings. The introduction of democracy, the city's establishment as capital of the homonymous city-state, and its merger with the surrounding small settlements (471 BC) were landmarks in the history of Elis. <br> <br>During the Peloponnesian War, the city's long-lived alliance with Sparta came to an end with devastating consequences for Elis. King Agis of Lacedaemon marched against Elis in 399 BC, King Philip II of Macedon supported the establishment of oligarchy and abolished democracy in 343 BC, and Telesphoros conquered the city in 313 BC. Aided by Roman troops, the city guard repelled an attack by King Philip V of Macedon in 209 BC, and in 191 BC, Elis joined the Achaian League. In 146 BC, it was conquered by the Romans and became part of the Roman province of Achaia; it came under the full authority of the Roman Empire as part of the Provincia Macedoniae in the early first century BC.<br> <br>Elis thrived in the Early Roman period and enjoyed numerous privileges because of its role in the organization of the Olympic Games. It was greatly influenced by Roman civilization and developed a multi-cultural identity due to the various ethnic groups, particularly Romans, living there. <br> <br>The barbarian invasions of Late Antiquity did not spare Elis. The city was raided by the Heruli (267 AD), the Visigoths (395 AD), and the Vandals (467 AD) before it was destroyed by two earthquakes in the sixth century AD. Life continued, however, during the seventh century, towards the end of which the city was definitively abandoned. Sporadic habitation among the ruins of the ancient city occurred in later centuries. <br> <br>Elis was the birthplace of several important figures of the ancient world, including Iphitus, who established the first Olympic Games (ninth or eighth century BC), the sophist Hippias (fifth century BC), and the sceptic Pyrron (365-275 BC). <br> <br>Elis was first excavated in 1910-1914 by the Austrian Archaeological Institute, whose director for the period 1911-1914 was Otto Walter. The Greek archaeologist Anastasios Orlandos participated in these early excavations. Nikolaos Gialouris resumed the excavations in 1960 for the Greek Archaeological Society. Recent work for the promotion of the archaeological site of Elis includes the removal of undergrowth, tree planting, the creation of visitors' paths, the installation of signs with explanatory texts, and the conservation and restoration of its monuments.<br>The extensive archaeological site of ancient Elis comprises the ancient agora, the theatre, the residential sector, the cemeteries, the acropolis, and the unexcavated gymnasiums. A number of settlements or suburbs, each with its own cemetery, developed around the city. Only small sections of the city have been investigated so far, but these provide enough information to help us imagine how the city looked. <br> <br>The agora remained largely unchanged until the very end, with some minor remodelling in the Roman period. Other early buildings, however, were replaced by new constructions particularly in the Late Hellenistic and Roman periods. Both the early buildings, which were built of ashlar blocks in the ancient Greek manner, and the later ones were systematically looted for building material in Late Antiquity and later periods. <br> <br>The theatre, a striking monument with a characteristic earthen cavea and a well-preserved stage building, occupied the north end of the agora. It enjoyed views of the river, which, in antiquity, ran very close by, along the city's north limits. A bridge crossed the river near that point and a strong embankment protected the city against floods. The Bouleuterion and the city's two gymnasiums were most probably located near the theatre, on a terrace by the riverbank. <br> <br>The city's religious and possible administrative centre occupied the agora's south end. Here, various buildings lie haphazardly within a relatively limited space: the built enclosure of a temple with a stepped porch and altar, several porticoes and ancillary rooms, a monumental two-roomed building of the Classical period and its later annex, and an incomplete rectangular building near the entrance to the agora. This last building has been tentatively identified as the peristyle tholos dedicated to the worship of the Roman Emperors, which was already abandoned in Pausanias's time. The agora's interior space was partly lined by two large and one small portico, the latter built as a continuation of one of the large ones. <br> <br>The city had densely populated residential blocks, wide streets, and several bathhouses. An impressive number of kilns was identified throughout the city. Two cemeteries were located at either end of the city, along the main road, and several small communities or suburbs developed along the same road. The acropolis occupied the top of a hill to the city's east.<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=4323'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q217667'>Wikidata ID: Q217667<\/a>","name":"Elis","modSource2":2,"placeID":"378214PEli","timePer":"ACHR","travelogues":9997,"pleiades":570220,"country":"Greece","region":"Peloponnese","dept":"Ileia","2011LG":"Ilidas","1997LG":"Amaliados","pre97":"Kalyvion Ilidos","mod":"Elis","works":98,"regionKML":"3EMed","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u0389\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2","concat1":"Elis (Eleia)","greek2":"\u1f2c\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2361642,"PHIsearch":"\u0397\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/570220","webPageData":21944,"work_id":2,"placeid":826,"count":4}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[21.5,37.7999999999999971578290569595992565155029296875]},"properties":{"pk":828,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":543,"priority":2,"ModSource":12,"latitude":37.7999999999999971578290569595992565155029296875,"longitude":21.5,"confidence":"High","description":"\u1f2e\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 - Eleia, ancient region and people in Eleia Peloponnese","concat2":"Eleia or Elis region (Eleia) 543 Ileia - \u0389\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2","featureTypes":"region\/people","icon":"region1.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23038544'>Wikidata ID: Q23038544<\/a>","name":"Eleia","modSource2":12,"placeID":"378215REle","timePer":"","travelogues":9997,"pleiades":570221,"country":"Greece","region":"Peloponnese","dept":"Ileia","2011LG":"Pyrgou","1997LG":"Olenis","pre97":"Koutsocheras","mod":"Ileia","works":90,"regionKML":"2Emed","styleID":"Region1","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"orange","2014EPKA":"\u0389\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2","concat1":"Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)","greek2":"\u1f2e\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2361634,"PHIsearch":"\u0397\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/570221","webPageData":"","work_id":2,"placeid":828,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.722300000000000608224581810645759105682373046875,38.0347000000000008412825991399586200714111328125]},"properties":{"pk":830,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":3,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.0347000000000008412825991399586200714111328125,"longitude":22.722300000000000608224581810645759105682373046875,"confidence":"Medium","description":"\u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 - Selleis?, river, the modern Seliandras in Korinthia, Peloponnese","concat2":"Selleis?

C. 2500 BC the settlement was fortified and its most important monument was the 'white house', a two-storey dwelling with corridors and verandas on the first floor. The city flourished during the Mycenaean period too (1600-1100 BC), as the precious finds ('Aegina treasure') and rich cemeteries indicate.<br\/>Aegina led the field in seafaring and maritime trade in the Mediterranean, particularly during the Archaic period (7th-6th century BC) and until the early 5th century BC. It is considered to be the first Greek city-state to mint its own silver coinage in the 7th century BC. The constant rivalry between Aegina and Athens resulted in the former's humiliating defeat in 457 BC and the settling of Athenian cleruchs on the island. Later it was subject successively to the kings of Macedonia and Pergamon, and in 133 BC to Rome.<br\/>The ancient city of Aegina lies under the present capital of the island. Sections of the Classical fortification and Late Roman towers survive ('wall of inscriptions' in the N part of the acropolis Kolona, 3rd century AD). Houses with wells in their courts, parts of the street network (Roman era) and many water conduits have been excavated. Richly furnished graves of different periods (late 8th century BC until Roman era) have been revealed in the ancient cemeteries (finds, including important early Archaic Corinthian and Attic vases, in the Aegina Museum).<br\/>On top of cape Kolona, where the ancient acropolis was located, are the crepis and one standing column of the Doric temple of Apollo (late 6th century BC). Parts of the Late Archaic peribolos and other buildings in the sanctuary (priests' houses, banqueting halls, storerooms) are also visible on the S flank of the hill. In the vicinity of the sanctuary are walls of the bouleuterion, two small temples (one perhaps of Artemis) and to the E of the hill a circular building identified as the funeral heroon of Phokos, son of the island's mythical king Ajax. On the N side of the hill is the Thearion, an area for cult rituals and banquets (late 6th century BC). Below Kolona, in the sea, are sections of the breakwaters and ruins of ancient ship sheds from the city's naval station, the so-called 'secret harbour' (kryptos limen, \u00ea\u00f1\u00f5\u00f0\u00f4\u1f78\u00f2 \u00eb\u00e9\u00ec\u1f74\u00ed). Under the new museum (former Quarantine Station in the time of Capodistrias) a large theatre, analogous in size to that at Epidauros, is being brought to light.<br\/>In a verdant landscape with panoramic view stands the restored Late Archaic temple of Aphaia, a local nymph who was later worshipped together with Athena. The sanctuary existed from the 8th century BC in the form of an open-air temenos. The first stone temple is dated c. 570 BC (maquette of the temple and restored front in the local archaeological collection). It was destroyed by fire c. 510 BC and the extant Doric temple was built immediately after, as well as its altar surrounded by two stoas with statues. Renowned are the sculptures from the temple's two pediments, which were purchased by King Ludwig of Bavaria in 1813 and are now exhibited in the Munich Glyptothek. Represented on both is the Fall of Troy, with Athena at the centre, flanked by many heroes in combat (W pediment c. 500 BC, E c. 490\/80 BC).<br\/>On the side of Mount Oros is the sanctuary of Zeus Hellanios or Panhellenios. The visible remains are of Hellenistic date, under the ruined Taxiarchis Monastery. Traces of cult and some building remains exist from as early as the 6th century BC. The sanctuary's altar stood on the summit of Oros.<br\/>Aegina was probably an episcopal see from the 4th century onward. Remains of a building with mosaic floor (5th century), a vaulted-roofed tomb and ruins of an Early Byzantine synagogue with mosaic floor (abandoned in the 7th century) have been uncovered in the town of Aegina. At Vardia, also in the town, are a two-aisled basilica (late 6th-7th century) and vaulted-roofed tombs. At Palaiochora Early Christian architectural members are incorporated in the one-time episcopal church of the Birth of the Virgin.<br\/>The finds are exhibited in the Aegina Archaeological Museum.<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=2670'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q191082'>Wikidata ID: Q191082<\/a>","name":"Aigina","modSource2":1,"placeID":"378234PAig","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":8866,"pleiades":579853,"country":"Greece","region":"Attica","dept":"Islands\/Aigina","2011LG":"Aiginas","1997LG":"Aiginas","pre97":"Aiginis","mod":"Aigina","works":113,"regionKML":"2Emed","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20140922,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u0391\u03af\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1","concat1":"Aigina (Aegina)","greek2":"\u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1","iDAIGAZ":2361319,"PHIsearch":"\u0391\u03b9\u03b3\u03b9","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/579853","webPageData":21936,"work_id":2,"placeid":889,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[21.13929999999999864712663111276924610137939453125,37.94051999999999935653249849565327167510986328125]},"properties":{"pk":927,"Z_ENT":894,"Z":"","hits":50,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":37.94051999999999935653249849565327167510986328125,"longitude":21.13929999999999864712663111276924610137939453125,"confidence":"Medium","description":"\u039a\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 - Kyllene, Archaic to Roman city with harbor works, later Glarentza, near Kyllini in Eleia Peloponnese","concat2":"Kyllene (Eleia) 50 Kyllini - \u039a\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlement.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=894'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q56650616'>Wikidata ID: Q56650616<\/a>","name":"Kyllene","modSource2":12,"placeID":"379211PKyl","timePer":"ACHR","travelogues":10297,"pleiades":570390,"country":"Greece","region":"Peloponnese","dept":"Ileia","2011LG":"Andravidas-Kyllinis","1997LG":"Kastrou-Kyllinis","pre97":"Kyllinis","mod":"Kyllini","works":18,"regionKML":"PelopNW4","styleID":"PolisLow","dateRevised":20180317,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7","concat1":"Kyllene (Eleia)","greek2":"\u039a\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/570390","webPageData":23300,"work_id":2,"placeid":927,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[21.1356999999999999317878973670303821563720703125,37.8864999999999980673237587325274944305419921875]},"properties":{"pk":928,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":8,"priority":5,"ModSource":12,"latitude":37.8864999999999980673237587325274944305419921875,"longitude":21.1356999999999999317878973670303821563720703125,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u1f59\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 - Hyrmine, Archaic to Hellenistic settlement near Chlemoutsi in Eleia Peloponnese","concat2":"Hyrmine (Eleia) 8 Chlemoutsi - \u03a5\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b7","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q535238'>Wikidata ID: Q535238<\/a>","name":"Hyrmine","modSource2":12,"placeID":"379211UHyr","timePer":"ACH","travelogues":"","pleiades":570305,"country":"Greece","region":"Peloponnese","dept":"Ileia","2011LG":"Andravidas-Kyllinis","1997LG":"Kastrou-Kyllinis","pre97":"Kastrou","mod":"Chlemoutsi","works":5,"regionKML":"PelopNW4","styleID":"SettlementLow","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a5\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b7","concat1":"Hyrmine (Eleia)","greek2":"\u1f59\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b7","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u03a5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b9","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/570305","webPageData":27449,"work_id":2,"placeid":928,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[21.519999999999999573674358543939888477325439453125,37.85000000000000142108547152020037174224853515625]},"properties":{"pk":929,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":16,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":37.85000000000000142108547152020037174224853515625,"longitude":21.519999999999999573674358543939888477325439453125,"confidence":"Nil","description":"\u1f1c\u03c6\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 - Ephyra?, Homeric town, unlocated, by the Selleis river in Eleia Peloponnese","concat2":"Ephyra?

Pausanias describes the site in Book Eight (14.1-15.4). <br>The site lies on a low hill just SE of the town of Kalivia. Little remains, save for some of the walls (now badly overgrown), and a Sanctuary of Asklepios lower down the slope on the SE. The sanctuary contains two buildings, one of them with a statue base of Asklepios sculpted by Attalos of Athens (2d c. B.C.). In front of the base there is a mosaic floor with a reservoir underneath. A colossal head of Hygeia in almost perfect condition, with inserted eyes and eyelashes still in place, was found in the same room. Coins found nearby confirm the site as that of Pheneos. (W. F.

Philip V decisively defeated the army of Euripidas (who had fled) there in 219-218 (Polyb. 4.67-69). It was one of the emperor Hadrian's benefactions to lead spring water from Stymphalos to Corinth. <br>The ancient acropolis lay on a promontory extending out toward the lake. On the highest point there are preserved the remains of a tower in the circuit wall from which can be observed the walls as they extend out on the landward side: the course of the wall, with its rounded towers, can be well followed in the plain, but disappears on the E under the waters of the lake. Descending toward the lake, one comes upon a small Temple of Polias with an altar in front and a nearly square building abutting it. Continuing down, one enters the agora (?), partially cut out of the rock of the acropolis. It contains a peculiar qoppa-shaped structure of ashlar polygonal masonry (4th c.) in part cut out of bed rock, a spring, and the remains of another structure (a stoa?) partially submerged in the lake. Also submerged in the lake are a Hellenistic temple and a palaestra. Farther along there are some rock-cut steps leading to the acropolis, a large dedication base, an exedra, the rock-cut cavea of a theater with some lower seats scattered about, and a rock-cut seat. The city of Pausanias' (8.22) time lay to the N near and under the ruined Frankish Katholikon. (W. F.

Representative of its wealth and pioneering spirit in architecture, is the Doric temple of Apollo which was built in 540 B.C. <br>The city was reinhabited in 44 B.C. and gradually developed again. In 51\/52 A.D., Apostle Paul visited Corinth. The centre of the Roman city was organized to the south of the temple of Apollo and included shops, small shrines, fountains, baths and other public buildings. <br>The invasion of the Herulians in A.D. 267 , initiated the decline of the city though it remained inhabited for many centuries through successive invasions and destructions, until it was liberated from the Turks in 1822. <br>Limited excavations were conducted in 1892 and 1906 by the Archaeological Society of Athens under the direction of A.

In the 4th millennium BC when human habitation first began on Salamis at several identified sites, the island may have been a peninsula of the mainland, joined where there are now the shallow straits below Megara.  At the beginning of the Mycenaean Age, one site emerged as the principal urban centre on the island: this was based around the citadel above the bay of Kanakia.  It appears to have had wide-ranging commercial connections, which included Cyprus; it reached its zenith in the 13th century BC, but was destroyed and deserted by 1150 BC.  It is probably the \u201cancient city\u201d referred to as the island's capital by Strabo (Geog. IX 1, 9). In the Iliad, Salamis contributed 12 ships to the Greek forces, led by Ajax, son of Telamon.  <br>In historic times, the island first belonged to the city of Megara; but its control became the object of dispute between Megara and Athens in the time of Solon.  It was annexed to Attica as a clerurchy by Peisistratos in the latter half of the 6th century BC, with the Athenians citing a forged line of Homer to support their claim.  It was at this time that the capital was moved from the southwest to the east coast of the island \u2013 today's bay of Ambelakia.  In the late summer of 480 BC, the Athenians evacuated their city in the face of Xerxes's push south after Thermopylae and made Salamis their base, trusting to the \u2018wooden walls' of their ships.  The battle fought in the straits between the east coast of the island and the Attic mainland was the most significant naval victory of early Greek history, and one of the most decisive for the course of Western history.  The island later became a battleground twice during the course of the Peloponnesian War in 429 and 405 BC, but remained in Athenian hands through the 4th century BC, until it surrendered to the Macedonian commander, Cassander, in 318 BC.  The island was restored to Athens again by Aratus in c. 230 BC. The Aianteia, a cult festival in honour of Ajax, continued to be celebrated on the island into the Roman period.  Byzantine churches and spolia from the 12th to 15th centuries on Salamis suggest an intermittent continuity of habitation, but there is a lack of written notices of the island in this and subsequent periods.<br>The ancient city of Salamis lay 1 km to the south of Paloukia, beneath the modern settlement of Ambel\u00e1kia, reached by taking the coastal road south from the point of disembarkation.  The city overlooked a deep bay formed by the pensinsula of Pounta to the north and the long, straight projection of land called the Kyn\u00f3soura (\u2018dog tail') to the south.  In the northwest corner of the bay can be seen the partially submerged moles of the ancient harbour.  On the southern slope of Pounta (to the north of the bay) a section of the ancient fortification wall, made in mud-brick on stone, can be seen underneath a protective roof.  The city has not been fully explored; but an agora framed by porticos, an altar to the Twelve Gods, a temple of Artemis, a theatre, and a Sanctuary of Ajax, are all referred to by Pausanias or in other written sources and inscriptions.  Though vestiges of the town's Hippodamian plan have been revealed by scattered excavations, most of it still remains to be uncovered.

Homeric Pellene, whose site is not known, was destroyed by Sikyon; the Classical city dates from the 6th c. and was refortified in Late Roman times. Pausanias mentions a gold-and-ivory statue by Pheidias in the Temple of Athena, as well as Sanctuaries of Eileithyia, Poseidon, Artemis, Dionysos, and Apollo Theoxenios (god of strangers). Games called the Theoxenia were limited to native competitors; the famous Pellene cloaks were at one time given as prizes. Scattered remains of buildings and walls mark the site, which is divided by a barren ridge, the main part of the city being on the W side, the smaller on the E. There has been some controversy over the location of Aristonautai, the port of Pellene: it was probably at Xylokastro at the mouth of the river. The ruins at Kamari, some 6 km to the W at the mouth of the next river, are perhaps to be identified with 4th c. Oluros, described by Pliny as the fortress of the people of Pellene, but apparently no longer of any significance in the time of Pausanias. The Sanctuary (Mysaion) and Sanatorium (Kyros) of Asklepios near Trikkala also belonged to Pellene. (M. H.

During the 20th century, the archaic temple was excavated by A. Philadelpheus in 1926 and by A. Orlandos in 1937. <br>The excavations of the Agora and its public buildings as well as of the Theatre, the roman Baths and the surrounding area started in 1926 with Philadelpheus, continued with A.

During the Mycenaean period (13th century BC) the Acropolis became the seat of a ruler. A stepped passage to the subterranean fountain was constructed and the rock was fortified with a mighty Cyclopean wall. The houses of the settlement and the graves were on the slopes, mainly in the area of the ancient Agora.<br\/>The Kerameikos cemetery, indicative of an organized polis, was arranged during the 12th-11th century BC.<br\/>The city's religious centre was on the fortified hill of the Acropolis, where building activity began in the 8th century BC and continued until the Roman era. Its zenith was in the 5th century BC. On its summit, among the foundations of other structures and monuments, three temples have survived, each one a landmark in ancient Greek architecture: the Doric Parthenon (447-438 BC, with its famous sculpted decoration on the metopes, frieze and pediments), where the Panathenaic procession ended and where the statue of Athena Parthenos as well as the city's 'treasury' were housed; the Ionic amphiprostyle temple of Athena Nike (421-415 BC); the peculiar Erechtheion articulated in two sections with the porch of the Karyatids (421-405 BC). Of the other important buildings the monumental Propylaia (with Doric and Ionic columns, 437-432 BC) still stand and the foundations can be seen of various sacred (temples of Zeus Polieus, Pandion, Brauronian Artemis, Pandemos Aphrodite, Roma and Augustus) and secular edifices (Pinakotheke, Chalkotheke), parts of the Classical fortification and a host of bases from all manner of ex-votos. On the south side of the Acropolis are the Theatre of Dionysos (mid-4th century BC) and the Roman Odeum of Herodes Atticus (AD 160-174), together with remains of buildings such as the Odeion of Pericles (mid-5th century BC), the Asklepieion (419-415 BC), the Stoa of Eumenes II (197-159 BC) and others.<br\/>Architectural sculptures and statues found on the top of the hill and its slopes are exhibited in the Acropolis Museum.<br\/>W of the Acropolis is the hill of the Areopagus, seat of the Athenian supreme court, and the hill of the Muses with the structures of the Pnyx, that is the place where the Ekklesia of the deme assembled. On the top of this hill is the Roman monument of Gaius Julius Antiochus Philopappus (AD 114-116). <br\/>The Agora was the administrative and political centre of the city. Of the host of buildings revealed in excavation we mention the Stoa of Zeus Eleutherios, the Royal (Basileios) Stoa, the Bouleuterion, the Tholos (Prytaneion), the Altar of the Twelve Gods, the Metroon, the temples of Apollo Patroos and Ares, the Eleusineion, the Stoa of Attalos, the Roman Gymnasium and the Odeum of Agrippa. The Agora Museum in the restored Stoa of Attalos houses finds from various parts of the Agora, presenting a picture of many aspects of public and private life in ancient Athens. Dominating the hill of Agoraios Kolonos is one of the best preserved Classical Doric temples, the Hephaisteion (popularly known as the Theseion, 449-444 BC).<br\/>In the 1st century BC the Roman emperor Augustus founded the Roman agora, to the E of the Greek Agora, in order to serve commercial needs. It includes a hypostyle court with porticoes, monumental propyla and other areas. Here stands the Horologion of Kyrrhestos (second half of 1st century BC), popularly known as the 'Tower of the Winds'. <br\/>The largest and best organized cemetery was at Kerameikos, on the NW outskirts of the city. Two main gates in the city wall, the Dipylon and the Sacred Gate, facilitated communication between Inner and Outer Kerameikos. Many funerary monuments have been revealed here, public and private, as well as dwellings and potters' workshops, and a building for ceremonial assemblies, the Pompeion. Very recently part of the Demosion Sema (Cemetery of the Deme), where many distinguished Athenians are known to have been buried, has been uncovered (graves in the Metaxourgeion neighbourhood).<br\/>There were several sanctuaries in the area of the river Ilissos, such as those of Delphinian Apollo, Herakles Pankrates, Kronos and Rhea. The unfinished yet magnificent temple of Olympian Zeus (begun by Peisistratos c. 530 BC, continued in the 2nd century BC and completed by Hadrian in the 2nd century AD) survives to this day, as does Hadrian's Arch (AD 131\/2) and the all-marble Panathenaic Stadium, which was restored in 1896 on the occasion of the first modern Olympic Games (first built c. 330 BC, rebuilt by Herodes Atticus in AD 140).<br\/>Noteworthy among the individual monuments dispersed throughout the modern urban web are the choregic monument of Lysikrates (335\/4 BC) in ancient Tripodon street, Hadrian's Library (AD 131\/2) and the area of Plato's Academy. Recent rescue excavations in Rigillis street have revealed large parts of the Lykeion (Lyceum), that is the philosophical school founded by Aristotle (4th century BC). Over the last few years a host of antiquities of all kinds and periods have been uncovered in various places, in the course of constructing the Athens Metro.<br\/>Athens maintained its reputation as an intellectual centre until the abolition of its schools of philosophy and rhetoric by Justinian I (AD 529). In AD 395 the city was threatened by the Goths under Alarich. In the 5th century ancient public buildings were renovated and new ones founded. Justinian I carried out radical repairs of the city wall. Remains of a building in honour of Arkadios and Honorios, sons of Emperor Theodosius I (c. 500) have been found in the area of the ancient Agora and S of the Odeum of Herodes Atticus, as well ruins of a gymnasium, private educational institutions (early 5th century), wells and watermills (early 6th century). A villa with mosaic floor has been uncovered in the National Garden (second half of 5th century). From the mid-5th century the pagan sanctuaries were converted into Christian churches. The ruins of many Early Christian churches have survived: the basilica of Saint Luke on the site now occupied by the homonymous church in Patisia, the Ilissos basilica, dedicated to Saint Leonidis (the most important Early Christian church in Athens, first half of 5th century), the 'Tetraconch' in the court of Hadrian's Library (first half of 5th century, converted into a three-aisled basilica in the early 6th century), the basilicas in the Olympieion, the National Garden, of Klematios, the Theatre of Dionysos, the Asklepieion and elsewhere.<br\/>A rich collection of mosaic pavements, Early Christian sculptures and other works of art of this period are exhibited in the Byzantine Museum.<br>[Judith Binder: Athenai: place-name: Iliad 2.546, 549; Od. 3.278, 307; Od. 7.80; Od. 11.323; Paus. 1.1.5 et passim; see Neai Athenai; Novae Athenae; Setines]<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q844930'>Wikidata ID: Q844930<\/a>","name":"Athens","modSource2":1,"placeID":"380237PAth","timePer":"BACHRLM","travelogues":8852,"pleiades":579885,"country":"Greece","region":"Attica","dept":"Athens C","2011LG":"Athinaion","1997LG":"Athinaion","pre97":"Athinaion","mod":"Athina","works":526,"regionKML":"1Med","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9","concat1":"Athens (Attica)","greek2":"\u1f08\u03b8\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/579885","webPageData":10975,"work_id":2,"placeid":1097,"count":6}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[24.42699999999999960209606797434389591217041015625,38.0270000000000010231815394945442676544189453125]},"properties":{"pk":1137,"Z_ENT":5073,"Z":"","hits":160,"priority":3,"ModSource":5,"latitude":38.0270000000000010231815394945442676544189453125,"longitude":24.42699999999999960209606797434389591217041015625,"confidence":"High","description":"\u039a\u1f71\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 - Karystos, Archaic to Roman polis, at Palaiochora above modern Karystos in Euboia Central Greece","concat2":"Karystos (Euboea) 160 Karystos - \u039a\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"polis.png","modernDescr":"The grand sweep of the setting of K\u00e1rystos is unexpected: the curve of its sheltered gulf, the majestic, concave rise of Mt.

The site of ancient Karystos lies a little to the north of the modern town, which was only created in the wake of the Greek Independence revolution; its acropolis is still prominently marked by the pinnacle of Castel Rosso, the rambling fortress, visible from all around, from which the Venetians held the south of the island. <br>Karystos is first mentioned in Book II of the Iliad: it took part in the Trojan War under the command of its king, Nauplios.  In Classical times it became the principal commercial and cultural centre of Southern Euboea, issuing its own coinage in the 6th century BC.  Glaukos, a boxer who was victor in the Olympic Games in 520 BC was from Karystos.  Remembering is destruction in 490 BC at the hands of the Persians, the city allied with Xerxes in the second Persian invasion, and was later treated punitively for its \u2018Medising' by Themistocles as a result. It was part of the First and Second Athenian confederacies, and after 338 BC came under Macedonian control.  Apollodorus, a Comic dramatist, and Antigonus, a bronze sculptor and writer, were 3rd century BC natives of Karystos.  The Romans took the city in 198 BC; their later exploitation of the marble quarries here made the city into an important and prosperous provincial centre \u2013 though Dio Chrysostom paints a (perhaps overly-rhetorical) picture of its economic decline already as early as the turn of the 2nd century AD. All this meant a wealth of commerce for the port of Karystos.  <br>One block north of the harbour (intersection of K\u00f3tsika and Sahto\u00fari streets) are the remains of a 2nd century AD Roman funerary monument of an obviously wealthy official in charge of the marble quarries.  It had the appearance of a small Ionic, peripteral temple, with 6 x 7 columns, and an entrance on the east side: its base and the cella threshold are visible.  Some of the marble from the structure and one of its decorative elements \u2013 a carved \u2018tondo' depicting the bust of a man with a bridled horse by his shoulder, which surmounted the doorway \u2013 is now incorporated, along with other antique marbles, in the east side of the 13th century tower on the harbour esplanade (east of Aiolou St.), known as the \u2018Bourtzi'.  The tower is a fortress, of irregular hexagonal form, with two cannon embrasures on the seaward wall, and well-preserved machicolations high up on the south wall.<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=5073'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q13554032'>Wikidata ID: Q13554032<\/a>","name":"Karystos","modSource2":5,"placeID":"380244PKar","timePer":"ACHR","travelogues":15500,"pleiades":570336,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Evvoia","2011LG":"Karystou","1997LG":"Karystou","pre97":"Karystou","mod":"Karystos","works":54,"regionKML":"Aegean3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20200626,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Karystos (Euboea)","greek2":"\u039a\u1f71\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2361852,"PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/570336","webPageData":22781,"work_id":2,"placeid":1137,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[20.589999999999999857891452847979962825775146484375,38.2000000000000028421709430404007434844970703125]},"properties":{"pk":1228,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":185,"priority":3,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.2000000000000028421709430404007434844970703125,"longitude":20.589999999999999857891452847979962825775146484375,"confidence":"High","description":"\u039a\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 - Kephallania, The largest of the Ionian islands","concat2":"Kephallania (Kefallenia) 185 Kephallenia - \u039a\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03af\u03b1","featureTypes":"island","icon":"region2.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178488'>Wikidata ID: Q178488<\/a>","name":"Kephallania","modSource2":12,"placeID":"382206IKep","timePer":"ACHRLM","travelogues":10497,"pleiades":530826,"country":"Greece","region":"Ionian Islands","dept":"Kefallinia","2011LG":"Kephalonias","1997LG":"Omalon","pre97":"Omalon","mod":"Kephallenia","works":53,"regionKML":"Ionian3","styleID":"Region2","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"orange","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03af\u03b1","concat1":"Kephallania (Kefallenia)","greek2":"\u039a\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03af\u03b1","iDAIGAZ":2299296,"PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/530826","webPageData":41200,"work_id":2,"placeid":1228,"count":2}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[21.64059999999999917008608463220298290252685546875,38.1537000000000006139089236967265605926513671875]},"properties":{"pk":1231,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":63,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.1537000000000006139089236967265605926513671875,"longitude":21.64059999999999917008608463220298290252685546875,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u1f6c\u03bb\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 - Olenos, unlocated Archaic to Hellenistic polis probably SW of Tsoukalaiika in Achaia Peloponnese","concat2":"Olenos (Achaia) 63 Tsoukalaiika\/Kamenitsa?

Kithairon and the Asopos (Ptol. Geog. 3.15.20; Plin. HN 4.2.6). It was also mentioned by Homer (Il. 2.504). <P>In 519 B.C. the city obtained the protection of Athens against Thebes, which was trying to annex it. It remained allied with Athens in the battles of Marathon, Artemision, and Salamis, and was sacked by the Persians in 479. For its strenuous resistance to the Persians and for its fidelity to Athens, Plataiai was honored with a gift of 80 talents for the Temple of Athena Areia. Phidias executed the cult statue and Polygnotos painted the walls of the pronaos for the temple. In 431 the Thebans again tried to take over the city. In 429 it was besieged by Archidamos, but its meager forces finally succeeded in forcing the blockade and reached refuge in Athens. In 427 it was occupied and rased to the ground although the temple of Hera was saved and a shelter for visitors was built near it. The Plataians returned to their city only to have it sacked by the Thebans; they retook it with the aid of Sparta, but were attacked again in 372 and the Thebans destroyed the city a second time. From this period until 338 the citizens of Plataiai enjoyed the hospitality of the Athenians. Philip led them home after Chaironeia, and the city was rebuilt under Alexander. During the Roman occupation Plataiai was not molested, in fact Justinian restored its walls. From the end of the 6th c. on Plataiai was a flourishing cult center of Hera (Paus. 9.3.8), of Demeter (Paus. 9.4.3), of Athena (Paus. 10.4.1), of Zeus Eleutherios (Paus. 9.3.5.7), of Artemis (Paus. 1.15.4), and of other minor cults as attested by inscriptions and coins. <br>Few vestiges of the city before 338 are preserved although near the internal NE corner of the Hellenistic walls there are a few remains of prehistoric walls, and excavation has brought to light fragments of prehistoric pottery and Mycenaean vases. The walls are rather complex. The enclosure built after 338 resembles a bulky polygon with the higher part to the S, where the extremity is defended by a tower. Behind this spur is a second curtain wall with numerous square towers. Circular towers protect the NW and NE corners; and two other extensions of the wall, NW-S and W-E, cross the site of the city. The maximum axes of the circuit are 1500 by 750 m. The 5th c. walls are rather rude work with a tendency toward polygonal technique; the 385 B.C. walls is isodomic work with a squared face; the 338 B.C. walls, restored under Philip, is isodomic trapezoidal work with a rounded face; later repairs and partial rebuilding under Alexander (?) are in isodomic technique with a squared and partly chiseled face. <br>The temple of Hera (49.9 x 16.7 m), was identified in 1891 on a terrace inside the city wall. To the N of the temple was found the Katagogion, a large hostel with a square plan and rooms on two stories, erected by the Thebans after the destruction of the city in 427 B.C. on a site that was later occupied by the Roman agora (Thuc. Hist. 2.69). Outside the walls to the W and NE are the necropoleis. Not even the site of the temple of Athena Areia has been identified. (N.

It is here that the most fascinating remains survive.>br \/>Styra is mentioned in the Iliad (Bk. II, 540) as participating in the Euboean expedition to Troy under the leadership of Elephenor.  Although Herodotus sees its inhabitants as of Dryopian origin, Strabo relates that the city was settled by colonists from the Marathonian Tetrapolis (Geog. X, 6).  In 490 BC it was taken by the Persian commander, Datis, and the offshore island of Aigilia was used for the safe-keeping of Persian hostages.  Styra contributed two ships to the Greek force at Salamis in 480 BC and soldiers to the Battle of Plataea; as a consequence its name was engraved with those of other participating Greek cities on the serpentine bronze trophy, now in the Hippodrome in Istanbul.  After 477 BC Styra was part of the Athenian Confederacy, and in 415 BC fought with Athens in the Sicilian campaign.  In Roman times the acropolis area may have been used as a settlement for the quarry-workers employed in the exploitation of the local stone.  The Venetians erected their fortress of Larmena or \u2018Armena', remains of which are visible today, on the site of the ancient fortifications. <br>The archaeological area (unsigned) of the quarries, the acropolis and the remarkable \u2018drakospita' or \u2018dragon's houses', are reached by taking the main road north from the square of (Palaia) Styra.  After 800m, on a bend, take the asphalt road to the right; after a further 800 m turn left onto a track, and then after 100 m turn right.  This track climbs for 1.5 km, at which point it is necessary to turn right at what is the first opportunity.  After 500 m, fork left.  After a further 500 m the track splits: from this point, left takes you, after 400m, to the foot of the hill where the drakospita (A) (10 minutes) can be visited; right leads on up to the principal quarries (B) (20 minutes) and the acropolis (C) (1 hour). <br>Site A: The (\u2018Palli-Lakka' group of) *Drakospita is found after a short climb up from where the left-hand track ends, in a dip in the hillside facing west with a partial view down to the coast at Nea Styra and with relatively good visibility of the surrounding quarry area.  As you approach you encounter two parallel, rectangular buildings with impressive, pitched and corbelled roofs constructed from large schists, which at first sight have the appearance either of communal dwellings or large animal pens. A shallow-cut, stone basin sits by the corner of the nearest building. Above and behind is a square building with a concentric, corbelled roof with an open \u2018oculus' in the centre, which could perhaps be covered, if necessary, with ephemeral material.  There is a stone corner-shelf inside. <br>As you climb higher, you pass two rectangular basins cut in the rock: the one to the left has a small circular depression carved on its front; further up again is an elliptical stone construction built up against the wall of natural rock behind, with two small \u2018loculi' to north and south, and a wall and doorway in front; substantially higher up, after crossing a scree of stones, is a vertical rock face (clearly cut by hand as evidenced by the chisel striations all over its surface) fenced by a wall and doorway in front.  This would appear to be one of many quarry faces in the area.  The rock face has a fissure (bottom right) faceted by human hand.  On the right-hand wall, in front and into the entrance of the fissure, at a height of about 2 m are a series of diagonal cuts in the rock \u2013 perhaps indicating approximate measurements for the quarrying.<br>There have been wild surmises as to the date and epoch of these constructions \u2013 some commentators even extravagantly claiming them to be prehistoric places of cult.  It should, however, be recalled that this whole area was dedicated in antiquity to quarrying stone; that stone-working was the main economic activity of Karystos and Styra; and that a community of people therefore lived on site in these quarries, to avoid the laborious trek to and from the town each day.  The mountains furthermore are subject to sudden storms and descending clouds for much of the early part of the year, and solid refuges would have been a real boon to the working community during the nights, and sometimes even during the day.  The limestone quarried here naturally splits into large slabs or schists, and if you were going to build a structure in this area, the method of superimposing large slabs and corbelling them for the roof, constitutes in fact the easiest solution.  The regular forms of the constructions and the roughly isodomic method (seen in much greater perfection in the drakospito at the summit of Mount Ochi), suggest that they emerge from a Hellenistic architectural background.  <br>Site B: The track and path up to the acropolis of Styra passes through the centre of the main, ancient limestone quarry \u2013 a series of small, quite deep, assays.  As you climb (15 minutes) there are channels in the stone and terraces cleared in the rock.  A number of shaped architectural pieces are still in situ: a finely tapered column (note the ring of circular indentations around the \u2018collar' for transportation); an abacus; several blocks of architrave with precise indentations.  The rough-hewn \u2018dromos', the long horizontal cuts and cart-ruts are evidence of the laborious task of transportation.  Other, ancient surface-quarries and screes of stone-refuse can be seen on the hillsides opposite.<br>The acropolis (reached after a 50-minute climb) is entered through the magnificent  *portal, which is visible even from Nea Styra far below and commands views of the whole of the gulf of Euboea.  It is composed of large monoliths of veined limestone, and its lintel is still in place.  To the left, as you face the gate from outside, are vestiges of the ancient enceinte, dating probably from the 5th century BC or earlier.  This site is an example of a natural rock acropolis which has been minimally modified and articulated to serve human ends.  It is composed of a ridge of limestone \u2018tors', running northeast\/southwest: the southwest tor has steps carved in its lower north side, which provided access to the look-out post on its summit.  As you skirt the east side of the ridge towards the northeast tor, there are deep-cut post-holes in the rock and other cuts for gate posts at the northern extremity of the ancient, inner acropolis.  Further north, you come to the tiny chapel of St. Nicholas (with a rock-cut cistern in front of its west end), and the remains of the 15th century Venetian stronghold, the Kastro Armeno, now much dilapidated, which had two discrete entities: a main, impregnable \u2018keep' on the summit of the middle tor and fortifications with bastions on the northeastern summit.  The *view takes in the sea to east and west, the three peaks of Attica in front, the Sounion peninsula, the islands of Makronisos, Kea and Skyros, the Boeotian coast, the Euripus, and Mounts Ochi, Dirfys and Kandili \u2013 in short, everything. There are few other examples in the Greek world of an acropolis set so distantly from the city it served to protect: communications between the two that were not signalled must have taken a couple of hours. It is maybe more appropriate to see this as an almost independent, fortified look-out post and refuge settlement.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q57758204'>Wikidata ID: Q57758204<\/a>","name":"Styra","modSource2":5,"placeID":"382242PSty","timePer":"ACHM","travelogues":"","pleiades":541117,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Evvoia","2011LG":"Karystou","1997LG":"Styreon","pre97":"Neon Styron","mod":"Styra","works":10,"regionKML":"Aegean4","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a3\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1","concat1":"Styra (Euboea)","greek2":"\u03a3\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1","iDAIGAZ":2362476,"PHIsearch":"\u03a3\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/541117","webPageData":22780,"work_id":2,"placeid":1263,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[20.42999999999999971578290569595992565155029296875,38.340000000000003410605131648480892181396484375]},"properties":{"pk":1277,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":23,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.340000000000003410605131648480892181396484375,"longitude":20.42999999999999971578290569595992565155029296875,"confidence":"Nil","description":"\u039d\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd - Neriton?, unlocated mountain on Odysseus's Ithaca, possibly Kefalonia, Ionian Islands","concat2":"Neriton?

Homer speaks of a maritime power formed by four islands: Ithaca, Dulichio, Same, and Zacinto (Od. 9.31). Ithaca, the mythical homeland of Odysseus and capital of his kingdom, was identified by Classical authors with the island of the same name which today is called Ithaki or Thiaki. Test trenches had been dug at various points on the island in 1868 and 1878, and excavations since 1930 have given ample credence to this identification. <br>Near the village of Stavros in the N of the island, on a hillside dominating the Bay of Polis in the locality called Pelikate, a settlement surrounded by a Cyclopean wall and an ancient Helladic necropolis have been discovered. The necropolis also contains pottery from the middle Helladic and Mycenaean phases. Traces of a rather large building and some Mycenaean pottery were found in 1937 at Tris Langadas, also in the vicinity of the Polis valley. A cavern excavated in the Bay of Polis contained finds from the Bronze Age to the 1st c. A.D., the most interesting are from the Geometric period, including bronze votive tripods. This was a grotto sanctuary in which a fragment from the 3d c. B.C. indicates that the Nymphs were venerated, while a fictile mask from the 1st c. A.D. significantly bears the name of Odysseus. The islet Daskalio offshore from Polis could be the Homeric Asteris, where the Proci awaited the return of Odysseus. Near Stavros there are also the remains of a necropolis with tombs from the 5th and 4th c. B.C. above a Bronze Age settlement. <br>Farther N, near Exoghi, the chapel of Haghios Athanasios is built on the ruins of a tower with archaic polygonal masonry. It is popularly called the School of Homer and the original plan, two rooms, is still recognizable. There are remains of a polygonal wall, within which votive objects have been found NE of the church. The wall probably enclosed a temple or an archaic sanctuary. Near the village of Exoghi one might locate the domain of Laertes; and a fountain brings to mind Melanthydros in the Odyssey. On the summit of Mt. Aetos, on the narrow strip of land that joins the N and S parts of the island, an archaic polygonal enclosing wall and other remains may be identified with Alakomenai, mentioned by Strabo. <br>On the slopes of Mt. Aetos, near a tower of the 5th c. B.C., a large sanctuary with a massive terracing wall has been found, and a deposit of local Geometric and imported Corinthian vases. Moreover, there are confused remains of tumuli of the LH III period, with ceramics from the 12th c. B.C. After the middle of the 8th c. W Greek and Cretan influence is evident in the ceramics from Mt. Aetos. The ceramic votive offerings seem to cease in the 4th c. B.C., but there are numerous terracottas from later epochs. Vathy, the modern capital of the island, is identified with the ancient port of Phorkys where Odysseus embarked. The grotto of Marmarospilia would be the grotto of the Nymphs, while the plain of Marathia would be the location of the stalls of Eumelus (Od. 14.6), and the fountain of Perapighadi may be the Arethusa. There is a small museum at Vathy. (M. G.

The modern city occupies exactly the same location as the ancient one, resulting in the absence of visible remains of the city's historical development. However, data recovered from rescue excavations help clarify the city's development during each time period. <br> According to that data the ancient city spread between Meganites river to the west and Kerynitis river to the east. Settlement ruins covering the entire Bronze Age have come to light at the northeastern part of Aigion, around the church of Eisodia and the so-called 'rock of the old bath'. The succession of phases, from the Early Helladic to the Mycenaean period, is very interesting. <br> The Mycenaean settlement at Aigion was an important one, having sent ships against Troy, according to Homer. The settlement was destroyed by fire twice. A megaron-like building dating to the Late Helladic IIIA-B period (15th-middle of 13th cent. B.C.) is particularly important. <br> The Mycenaean cemetery of Aigion lies at Psila Alonia. Of the 30 chamber tombs known so far, half have been excavated, while the rest had already been plundered. The wealthy cemetery was already in use as early as the LH II period (beggining of 16th cent. B.C.) a rare feature in the area of Achaia. At the western part of the city, at Kallithea, there was another large cemetery, possibly an extention of the Psila Alonia one. <br> Finds from the geometric cemetery, as well as remains of a settlement dating to ca. 600 B.C. prove the continuous habitation of the city to the archaic pariod. During the classical period Aigion's plan changes. The city now occupies the western part of modern Aigion, near the water reservoir. Remains of a house dating to that period have been found in Solomou St. The classical cemetery was organised northwest of the water reservoir. <br> Hellenistic Aigion is better documented. This is the time when the city was capital of the Achaean League, even after 146 B.C. and the Roman conquest. Numerous rescue excavations have brought to light ruins of well-sized and well-built houses, as well as parts of the city walls and a comprehensive plumbing and sewage system. All these account for a prosperous and influential Hellenistic city. <br> During the Roman period Aigio spreads along the waterfront and develops further, as proven by the presence of luxurious houses and a bath complex at the city centre. This is the period when the Egyptian cults of Mithras and Isis were introduced to the city. According to Pausanias Aigion still enjoyed considerable status during the 2nd cent. A.D., mainly because of the famous sanctuary of Zeus Omargyrios, which gave Aigio the fame of a holy city. Sadly, the complete absence of epigraphical evidence prevents us from identifying architectural remains and other finds with the monuments referred to in Pausanias' accounts. <br> Small finds from all excavations can be seen at Aigion Archaeological Museum.<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=2097'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60790078'>Wikidata ID: Q60790078<\/a>","name":"Aigion","modSource2":3,"placeID":"383221PAig","timePer":"NBGACHR","travelogues":8867,"pleiades":570049,"country":"Greece","region":"Peloponnese","dept":"Achaia","2011LG":"Aigialeias","1997LG":"Aigiou","pre97":"Aigiou","mod":"Aigio","works":32,"regionKML":"PelopNW3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20160225,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u0391\u03af\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd","concat1":"Aigion (Achaia)","greek2":"\u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd","iDAIGAZ":2361320,"PHIsearch":"\u0391\u03b9\u03b3\u03b9","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/570049","webPageData":21941,"work_id":2,"placeid":1298,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.97200000000000130739863379858434200286865234375,38.2563999999999992951416061259806156158447265625]},"properties":{"pk":1307,"Z_ENT":2907,"Z":"","hits":25,"priority":4,"ModSource":4,"latitude":38.2563999999999992951416061259806156158447265625,"longitude":22.97200000000000130739863379858434200286865234375,"confidence":"High","description":"\u0398\u1f77\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9 - Thisbai, Archaic to Late Antique polis near modern Thisbe (Kakosi) in Viotia Central Greece","concat2":"Thisbai (Boeotia) 25 Thisbi - \u0398\u03af\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlement.png","modernDescr":"A city at the S foot of Mt. Helikon, on the site of the modern town; it is situated in a corridor 350-700 m wide between a rocky hill to the N (Palaiokastro) and, to the S, the edge of a plateau linked to Mt. Helikon (Neokastro). <br>The site had an important Mycenaean settlement; in Classical times, up to 338 B.C., Thisbe formed part of one of the districts of Thespiai. Thereafter the city was independent. In 172 B.C. it sided with Perseus but was forced to open its gates to Flamininus; a senatus consultum of October, 170, settled the matter to the advantage of the Romans (IG VII 2225). The city ramparts ran around the two hills and the lower city. A wall of coarse polygonal masonry runs across the NW part of Palaiokastro (acropolis). The E wall of the lower city and the Neokastro rampart are of regular 4th c. masonry; the eight towers have finely grooved corners. The W rampart has disappeared. Remains of the ancient city include some hundred reliefs and inscriptions dating from the 5th c. B.C. to the 3d c. A.D. (at the Thebes Museum and in modern buildings at Thisvi and Korini, 1.5 km to the SE), as well as quantities of pottery ranging from the Mycenaean to the Roman period. <br>To prevent flooding in the lower (E) section of the Thisbe basin a long dike was built N-S, noted by Pausanias; two sluices regulated the passage of water. The road running from Thisbe to its port, now Vathy, on the Gulf of Corinth, passed over the dike. (P.

B.C.). One of the most important Mycenaean administrative centres (palaces) of Mainland Greece lays in about the centre of the Kadmeia citadel. Its various wall painted annexes and 'departments' covered a great part of the natural hill of Thebes. Parts of the palace were excavated by A. Keramopoullos (1906-1929) and later (1963-1995) by archaeologists of the 9th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities. Particularly important are the archives in Linear script B, the inscribed stirrup-jars, the 'Room of the Treasure' and the 'Armoury'. <br>The Temple of Apollo Ismenios, belongs to one most important cult of Thebes (the other was the cult of Demeter Thesmophoros). It is situated on the pine-covered hill between the cemetery (Aghios Loukas) and the Electran Gates. The temple was excavated by A. Keramopoullos. Its remains belongs in a temple with dimensions 21,60X9,30 m and columns respectively 12X6, built perhaps after the battle of Leuktra (371 B.C.). Before the 4th B.C. temple, there, in the same place a geometric and late an archaic one. From the latter parts of its terracotta superstructure were found. <br>The Gates of Kadmeia. From the seven mythological gates of Thebes, whose names (often more than seven) are known from the tradition, only the entrance between the two circular towers of the Electran Gates are preserved today. In the place of Proitides and Homoloides Gates were preserved sections of the Mycenaean wall (excavations 1915 and 1984). The other gates are hypothetically located with the help of the natural exits from the city. The towers of the Electran Gates were excavated by A. Keramopoullos (1908) and were dated in the time of the city's rebuilding by Kassander (315 B.C.).<br>Several rescue excavations and less systematic work in the area of ancient Thebes yielded an abundance of evidence for the city's history and art. However continuous occupation and the presence of a thriving modern town over the ancient remains rendered impossible a full investigation of the site. Occupation began in Neolithic times (Pyri) and the settlement was already strong in Early Helladic (3000 - 2000 B.C.) and Middle Helladic period (2000 - 1680 B.C.). The city reached its highest point of splendour and power in Mycenaean period (1600-1100 B.C.). Thebes was a considerable settlement in geometric and archaic times and during the classical period gained 'the hegemony' over the rest of Greece (371-362 B.C.). After the battle of Chaironeia (338 B.C.) and its complete destruction by the Macedons (335 B.C.). Thebes never regained its former glory and power. <br>In the years before 1900 only sporadic excavations took place in the area of Thebes. Between 1906 and 1929 A. Keramopoullos excavated remains of the Mycenaean palace and of fortifications on the Kadmeia as well as several Mycenaean chamber tombs and the foundations of the Temple of Apollo Ismenios. N. Platon and E. Touloupa (1963-1965) and later other members of the Greek Archaeological Service revealed some important parts of Mycenaean administrative center on the citadel as well as the foundations of ancient and medieval buildings investigated in the Lower town. Quite recently (1993-95) a cospicuous number of clay tablets (c.250) were found in the area of the so-called 'Armoury'. <br>Restoration work at Thebes began, for the first time in 1994 with the consolidation and restoration of the monumental chamber tomb of the 'Sons of King Oedipus' in the hills of Kastellia.

The name refers to two settlements, the older of which was at the foot of Mt. Kurios (Strab. 10.451) between the river Acheloos and the river Euenos, and was mentioned by Homer (Il. 2.638). Pleuron, according to Strabo, was founded by the Kouretes; or Thoas, son of Aeneas, guided the Aitolians there (10.461). When Demetrios II of Macedonia destroyed Pleuron the inhabitants founded a new city on the uplands of Arakinthos, which had the protection of Rome before the taking of Corinth. During the Imperial age the uprisings in Aitolia continued. The ruins of the more ancient city are N of the newer one and cosist of a few remnants of Cyclopean walls. Nea Pleuron has been identified on the Arakinthos (Zygos) in the locality of the castle of *kuri\/as *ei)rh\/nhs. The city wall is a large rectangule with seven gates and 31 towers served by stairways. The masonry is partly trapezoidal and partly peudo-isodomic with squared faces, well preserved almost everywhere, and datable to ca. 230 B.C. The acropolis occupies the upper part of the site, but little of it remains. A Byzantine chapel was built on the remains of the Temple of Athena. The actual city occupies a vast terrace 243 m above sea level, with which it is linked N-S by a defense wall that also encircles the port. The civil buildings are to the S. The theater is in the SW part of the city with the proscenium leaning against the inside surface of the city wall. The central part of the building housing the skene is a tower. The proscenium had six columns, and the parascenia must have been elevated above it and must have leaned against the wall. The circle of the orchestra is tangent to the skene building. The cavea, well preserved at the N, had five sections and six staircases. The construction of the theater is contemporary with that of the walls. Several other areas are recognizable within the city walls, including the site of the agora, with a stoa oriented N-S and ca. 62 m long, and the plan of the gymnasium. To the SE was a large communal cistern (30 x 20 m) with five rectangular basins. There are also remains of unidentifiable public buildings and rather extensive remnants of houses and cisterns. The necropoleis extend to the S of the terrace occupied by the city. (N.

Arakynthos. It is mentioned in the Iliad where it is the scene of the struggle between Herakles and the river god Acheloos, and of the hunt for the Kalydonian boar. <br>The city lay on a hill with two summits and in the valley below. There are a few remains of the circuit walls dating from the beginning of the 3d c. B.C.; the perimeter was ca. 4 km and there were occasional towers. The acropolis, to the NW, was well fortified and had a double gate flanked by two towers; inside this was a large inner courtyard. The road to Stratos, the ancient capital of Akarnania, left the city through that gate. The W gate was also handsome and well fortified; it was on the axis of the Via Sacra, 400 m long, which led to Laphrion, the sacred precinct situated on a narrow plateau and probably dedicated in the 8th c. B.C. to the worship of Artemis and Apollo. <br>Various periods of construction in Laphrion are distinguishable. Two Doric temples in antis date from the end of the 7th c. B.C.; Temple A was dedicated to Apollo (or Dionysos?) and Temple B to Artemis. Remains of Temple B include terracotta decorations (sima, antefixes, akroteria, and metopes). Between the first decade and the second half of the 6th c. these two temples were refaced. To that period belongs a series of terracotta metopes from Temple A, painted with mythological figures whose Corinthian origin is confirmed by letters in the Corinthian alphabet incised before the metopes were fired. From Temple B in the same period come antefixes with anthemia, an akroteria with sphinxes, and metopes that depict the Labors of Herakles. About 500 B.C. Temple B was enclosed by a portico. Two other small buildings belong to the 6th c.; one of them, an apsidal structure, yielded numerous votive offerings to Artemis and Dionysos. <br>At the beginning of the 4th c. B.C. the entire zone was remodeled and buttressed by massive ramparts. A portico was built to the SE, with six columns along the front, and ca. 360 a peripteral Doric temple in poros, with 6 by 13 columns, arose on the site of the Temple of Artemis. It had a marble roof, gutters with spouts representing dogs' heads, and sculptured metopes (only a single undecipherable one remains). In the cella, which probably had 20 channeled Ionic columns, stood the chryselephantine statue of Artemis, the work of Menaechmos and Soidas of Naupaktos (460 B.C.) mentioned by Pausanias (7.18.10). This statue is believed to be represented on some coins of Patras. An altar, an exedra, and an entrance propylon are of the same date as the temple. In the Hellenistic period, N of the sacred precinct, a large square was built; it had a long stoa with two aisles, probably further divided into different lanes and decorated at the ends by two large semicircular niches (3d-2d c. B.C.). To the W of the square stairs led to the valley of the Kallirhoe river. <br>In the remaining area, limited to the N by the city gate and to the S by a slope, the remains of a series of small archaic thesauroi have yielded abundant terracotta objects and some Hellenistic tombs. The most important of these, in a valley to the SE, is the heroon, also called the Leonteion after its owner, Leon of Kalydon. It is a rectangular building (37.5 x 34.4 m) dating from ca. 100 B.C., with rooms on three sides, and promenades, around a square peristyle (16.78 m on a side). The largest room, to the N, has at least 11 large medallions on the walls, on which are carved the gods and heroes of the legendary history of Kalydon. An arch on the N side of the room leads to a small chamber below which is the hypogeum, with a barrel vault and marble sarcophagi in the form of beds. A second heroon has been discovered in the valley of the Kallirhoe. <br>The decline of Kalydon began in the Roman era during the struggle between Caesar and Pompey, when the city was occupied by Pompey's followers. In 30 B.C. the inhabitants of Kalydon were transferred to Nikopolis. The major terracotta finds, marvelous documents of archaic Corinthian painting, are in the National Museum at Athens. The stone gate of the crypt of the heroon is also there. (L.

The walls are probably contemporary with the early Christian, three-aisled basilica on top of the mound dating from the 7th century AD and from which the name of the mound derives. Outside the medieval walls, remains of terrace walls, probably constructed in Archaic times and simultaneously used to defend the Acropolis, were found. They were re-used, restored and reinforced in Classical and Hellenistic times. In the 4th century BC, large, 2.7-metre-broad double-faced, dry stone walls were constructed of lime stone ashlars quarried at mount Varassova, underlining the defensive character of the installations on the Acropolis in Antiquity. The remains of workshops, storerooms and habitation buildings from Archaic, Classical and early Hellenistic times, were excavated on the broad terrace on the east side of the mound and, in the plain west of Aghia Triada, towards Kato Vasiliki, trial trenches in 1998 uncovered habitation layers up to four metres deep with rich Prehistoric habitations from the Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age and five to six superposed Archaic settlements. Significant investigations were continued during a further three campaigns until 2001. Geological examinations in 1997-1998 indicated that the ancient harbour mentioned by Thucydides, must have been located in the flat land west of the mound and that the habitation excavated was a part of the harbour district of the small Corinthian emporion.

The modern name for the eastern summit, the one most closely associated with the Muses, is Zagaras (1525 m). The footpaths to the summit are steep and poorly marked. The famous Hippocrene spring is identified with a rock-lined well\/cistern below the main summit. <br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q215516'>Wikidata ID: Q215516<\/a>","name":"Helikon","modSource2":6,"placeID":"384228LHel","timePer":"","travelogues":13491,"pleiades":540808,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Viotia","2011LG":"Levadeon","1997LG":"Kyriakiou","pre97":"Kyriakiou","mod":"Elikona","works":74,"regionKML":"CentGrC3","styleID":"Mountain","dateRevised":20190621,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u0395\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd","concat1":"Helikon Mt.

Helikon and near the W end of Lake Kopais. <br>The city was famous from the 6th c. B.C. for its Oracle of Trophonios, which, together with those of Delphi, Abai in Phokis, Dodona, and the Amphiareion, was one of the five great Greek oracles. It was consulted by Croesus (550 B.C.), Mardonios (480), and later by Paulus Aemilius (168 B.C.). Pausanias describes it in detail (9.39.5-13). Together with Koroneia and Haliartos, the city formed one of the 11 Boiotian districts from 447-387 and from 371-338 B.C., then became an autonomous city in the Boiotian Confederacy. It was sacked by Lysander in 395 B.C., then again by Mithridates' forces in 86 B.C. Flourishing once again from the 2d c. A.D., it developed in the Byzantine period, thanks to its strategic position and its cotton industry. <br>The ancient city, very little of which remains, was situated on the right bank of the Herkyna, N of the modern town, at the foot of the acropolis which has been placed at Trypolithari. In recent excavations some 4th c. buildings have been discovered at Levadhia. The river Herkyna flows S of the town in a deep narrow gorge between Mt. Haghios Ilias to the W and Mt. Granitsa (formerly Laphystios) to the E. There are several abundant springs on both sides of the valley; people consulting the oracle drank the waters of Lethe and Mnemosyne. In the rock on the left bank are hollow niches for statues and a square chamber (4 m each side, 3 m high) with two seats, possibly the Sanctuary of Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche. At the W end of the gorge the lower tower of the mediaeval fortress is apparently built over the Temple of Trophonios. <br>On Mt. Haghios Ilias, on whose slopes the Catalans built a fortress in the 14th c. that can still be seen, was the Sacred Grove, near the Chapel of the Panagia, the Oracle of Trophonios, and the Temple of Zeus Basileus. Recently discovered by Greek archaeologists, the site of the oracle is a few m SW of the Temple of Zeus. It consists of a well ca. 4 m deep and 2 m in diameter (approximately the dimensions given by Pausanias). At the bottom of the well, in the middle, is a cavity the width of a man's body; it extended toward the SW underneath the wall of the well. The cave was sealed with a rough stone. In its present state the somewhat careless construction looks as if it dates from the 3d c. A.D. The identification seems certain. <br>The Temple of Zeus Basileus, which was never finished, is in almost complete ruin. The E foundations and some carved blocks have just been uncovered. Construction was begun, or perhaps resumed, between 175 and 171 B.C. with money offered by Antiochos IV Epiphanes, king of Syria. Several inscriptions give the building plan in detail. It was apparently a large Doric temple, peripteral, oriented E-W, with an apse in the rectangle of the sekos and a cross-wall with three doors in it. It may have been intended for ceremonies involving processions around an inner altar. The Boiotian Confederacy started the Basileia festivals at Lebadeia, to commenorate the Spartans' defeat at Leuktra in 371; held in Panamos month (August-September), they included athletic contests and horse races. Foreign delegations, notably from Athens, took part in the religious ceremonies. (P.

The two hills of the ancient polis of Koroneia are situated in the middle of two valleys, being the end part of a ridge which cuts the larger valley into two longitudinal sections (Butsurati). The Western one is wider, while the Eastern valley is narrower, and runs steeply down from the slopes of Helicon which constitute the Labethrion\/Tilphousion ridge.  There are remains of an undated polygonal circuit of walls around the acropolis, enclosing an area of 38ha (Fossey 1988: 325-6); another circuit of walls of an unknown date enclosing the lower town could still be seen in the 19th century (Frazer 1913: 70).

B.C.). Spared by the Persians in 480, it became one of the 11 Boiotian districts, with Koronea and Lebadeia, from 447 to 387 and then from 371 to 338. At the beginning of the Corinthian War (395) Lysander and the Spartan army joined battle with the Boiotians under the walls of Haliartos, and he was killed there. During the Third Macedonian War Haliartos joined forces with Perseus against Rome: the praetor C. Lucretius razed the town, destroyed the garrison, and sold 2,500 citizens as slaves. Its territory was given to Athens, which administered it through an epimeletes and sent colonists there. The city was never rebuilt. <br>The acropolis is on a low hill to the W of the modern town between the highway and the railroad; it controlled traffic between N and S Greece. The Mycenaean acropolis (ca. 250 x 150 m) is situated at the highest point of the hill; its rampart is well preserved to the S and W. On the W side of the hill is a second type of wall composed of large quadrangular blocks laid in more or less horizontal courses; it dates from the 7th c. B.C. On the S slope and at the SE corner are remains of two towers; the masonry here is polygonal and very workmanlike, the stones being laid on one or two courses of wide, flat rectangular blocks. It possibly dates from the end of the 6th or beginning of the 5th c. A fourth type of wall, of which only the foundations remain, was made of blocks of crumbly red or yellow limestone (tower near the SW corner). To the W, 100 m from the NW corner, was a gate 3.50 m wide. Built in the 4th c., this rampart was razed by the Romans in 171 B.C. On its surface can be seen significant traces of an Imperial or Byzantine wall made of small rocks bonded with mortar. <br>At the very top of the acropolis, excavations have uncovered (1926-30) a Temple of Athena surrounded by a peribolos wall, a large building, and the passageway that served both; everything had been razed, no doubt in 171 B.C. The temple, which was built in the 6th c., was distyle in antis; it was of the archaic elongated shape (7.10 x 18 m) and open to the E. Several regular courses of limestone have been preserved, on poros foundations. Fragments of poros columns and some architectural terracottas were found to the E. Along the N wall are the foundations of an earlier temple (7th c.?). The peribolos wall, which is rectilinear to the S (36 m) and a flat semicircle to the N, is of fine polygonal masonry laid in horizontal courses. To the S of the temple is a large building (21 m N-S, 8.90 m E-W) with polygonal walls of the same type, dressed on both sides. Two doorways opened in the E wall. Inside the building four wooden pillars on square stone bases supported the roof. Its purpose is unknown. A large store of vases, lamps, and terracottas at the W foot of the peribolos shows that the Temple of Athena was used from the 6th to the beginning of the 2d c. B.C. A small necropolis, SE of the acropolis, provides evidence that the site was occupied in Roman times. <br>E of Haliartos, on the chain dividing Lake Kopais from the Teneric Plain, was the very ancient Temple of Poseidon Onchestios; it was the center of the Boiotian Confederacy from 338 to 146.

The site, described by Pausanias as 15 furlongs (3 km) from the mountain of the Sphinx (Mt. Phaga), is generally agreed to be on the ridge between the two Boiotian plains. The road and railroad use the S and N passes over it; in the former there are a few blocks of an ancient wall at an angle to the road. Here Lauffer reported finding the limestone foundations of the temple. (M. H.

The modern settlement was founded as \u2018Nea Psar\u00e1' in 1824 by refugees from the island of Psar\u00e1. The new town overlies much of the ancient city, whose ruins are the most extensive on Euboea.  3 km to the north of the town are the ancient quarries (now reactivated) of the beautiful maroon-red and white decorative marble, known as marmor chalcidicum or \u2018Chalcidian marble' to the ancients, and as Fior di pesco (\u2018peach flower') during the Renaissance. Traces of Mycenaean, Proto-Geometric and Geometric occupation have been found on the acropolis above the site, suggest a pre-existing occupation.  The city of Miletus had come to the aid of Eretria in the Lelantine struggle, and it was perhaps for this reason that Eretria in turn joined Athens in supporting the Ionian revolt led by Miletus in the first years of the 5th century BC.  In the revolt, Sardis, the local Persian capital, was razed by the Greeks.  That conspicuous support cost Eretria dearly: when Darius invaded Greece is 490 BC, almost his first objective was the destruction of Eretria and the enslavement of its people. <br>The city recovered from the devastation and sent significant contingents to both the battles of Salamis in 480 and Plataea in 479 BC. Thereafter, in spite of a rebellion in 446 BC, the city was largely under Athenian control until it broke free in 411 BC, when Athens's attentions were elsewhere in the aftermath of the Sicilian debacle.  In 377 BC it joined the Second Athenian Confederacy. Caught up in the intrigues between Athens and Macedonia, and subsequently between Macedonia and Rome, it was sacked by the Romans 198 BC. After a second destruction in 87 BC during the Mithridatic wars, the ancient city was never rebuilt. <br>The principal archaeological sites lie scattered to both sides of the main highway.  To the north of the highway are the West Walls and West Gate; a circuit of nearly 4 km of walls surrounded and protected the city, joining the acropolis hill in the northeast with the harbour in the southeast corner.  The first enceinte was built (further to the east) in the 8th century BC.  The one visible here dates from c. 400 BC and is well-preserved, with the moat and the bases of external bastions extant along the western section of the excavated area, north of the highway.  At the point where the ancient road from Chalcis entered the city is the West Gate and Barbican, constructed with a wide variety of kinds of masonry.  The base of the walls in a tightly interlocking trapezoidal system is particularly impressive; the ample vaulted passage beneath that drained off the torrent is also finely constructed with a round arch at one end and a corbelled support at the other. <br>Directly inside and to the southeast of the West Gate are the remains of a small Hero\u00f6n in which were incorprated some noble-family tombs containing weapons and grave goods dating from the 8th century BC. At that time the Hero\u00f6n would have been outside the city walls which were only enlarged and moved further west in the late 5th century BC. In reaching this point on the site from the entrance to the archaeological area, you will have traversed an excavated area of large residences or so-called \u2018Palaces', some contiguous with the West Wall.  There are several superimposed layers of construction in this area, but the houses at the highest level, mostly built around a central peristyle court, date from the late 5th and 4th centuries BC. A well-preserved clay bath remains in situ in one. Many different colours and types of stone were used for the threshold blocks. <br>To the northeast of the West Gate is the base of a 4th century BC Temple of Dionysos, which was a Doric, peripteral structure with an altar which stood a short distance to the east. As is appropriate for Dionysos, the presiding divinity of drama, the precinct of his temple abuts the 5th century BC Theatre, whose form is clear although it has largely been left covered by earth.  It is curious that the natural slope of the acropolis hill to the east was not used to create the theatre, and that massive terracing had therefore to be undertaken to support its cavea on this flatter site. It retains its seven lower rows of seats, much defaced; the upper tiers, which were exposed to view, have nearly all been removed, block by block, to build the modern village. A semicircular drainage channel almost 2m wide runs in front of the lowest row. The design has unusual innovations: from the orchestra, steps descend through a square opening into an underground vaulted passage, leading to the hyposkenion; this was used for the sudden appearance and disappearance of agents of the underworld, as well as for the facilitating of special sound effects. The high stage is raised on seven or eight courses of masonry. <br>Further east, at the foot of the acropolis and above an area identified as the Stadium, is a Gymnasium which was first excavated in 1895. By its west end was found an inscribed stele set up in honour of a gymnasiarch and benefactor. At the eastern extremity is an extensive series of water conduits which supplied the bathing troughs, still clearly visible along the side of a room with plain mosaic floor. <br>Above the Gymnasium, paths lead up to the acropolis where the late 5th century BC enceinte and its well-preserved towers in isodomic masonry are visible, especially to the east side. On the way up are (left) remains of a Thesmophoreion (Sanctuary to Kore and Demeter) and (right) the sanctuary of a female deity, perhaps Artemis Olympia.  In returning once again towards the highway, you pass the \u2018House of the Mosaics', recognisable because it is partly covered by a modern building and roof. This is a large and important residence \u2013 sometimes attributed to the philosopher Menedemos \u2013 constructed around 370 BC with a private area and an ample public area.  Much of the furniture and small objects, including the exceptional terracotta Gorgon's head, which were found here are exhibited in the Museum. The figurative mosaics \u2013 especially those in the middle reception room on the north side \u2013 are preserved in situ.  They are executed mostly in black and white, and soberly highlighted with colour.  The house appears to have been destroyed by fire a hundred years after it was built. <br>On a hill 1 km west of the theatre, a tumulus encloses a Macedonian Tomb. (Key held by Museum. Not signed. Take asphalt road parallel to west side of the archaeological area; then first fork left. Road climbs; as it turns sharply right, the tomb is at the summit of the hill crowned with pines.) The neatly cut dromos on the north side leads to a square vaulted chamber, containing two funeral couches in marble, with their pillows and draperies, two thrones and a table, all once coloured.  A funerary sculpture \u2013 a lion or a sphinx \u2013 would have marked the grave from above. <br\/>Three other points of interest lie further to the southeast.  A meticulously cut, circular base with a central circular pit is visible in an area occupied by the ancient agora.  This tholos dates from the 4th century BC and is possibly also the sanctuary of, or monument to, a hero.  Beyond it, on what was the edge of the harbour in ancient times are the baths of the 4th century BC, probably belonging to a gymnasium complex.  To the east of these are the ruins of a Temple of Isis, whose cult was introduced into the Greek world by mariners and merchants returning from Egypt.  The broken cult statue in terracotta was found in situ when the building was excavated in 1917. <br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=804'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16562724'>Wikidata ID: Q16562724<\/a>","name":"Eretria","modSource2":5,"placeID":"384238PEre","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":15695,"pleiades":579925,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Evvoia","2011LG":"Eretrias","1997LG":"Eretrias","pre97":"Eretrias","mod":"Eretria","works":71,"regionKML":"3EMed","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u0395\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1","concat1":"Eretria (Euboea)","greek2":"\u1f18\u03c1\u1f73\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1","iDAIGAZ":2361665,"PHIsearch":"\u0395\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/579925","webPageData":21973,"work_id":2,"placeid":1412,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[21.373000000000001108446667785756289958953857421875,38.47399999999999664623828721232712268829345703125]},"properties":{"pk":1436,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":10,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.47399999999999664623828721232712268829345703125,"longitude":21.373000000000001108446667785756289958953857421875,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u03a0\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 -

Delphi was regarded as the centre of the world. According to mythology, it is here that the two eagles sent out by Zeus from the ends of the universe to find the navel of the world met. The sanctuary of Delphi, set within a most spectacular landscape, was for many centuries the cultural and religious centre and symbol of unity for the Hellenic world. The history of Delphi begins in prehistory and in the myths of the ancient Greeks. In the beginning the site was sacred to Mother Earth and was guarded by the terrible serpent Python, who was later killed by Apollo. Apollo's sanctuary was built here by Cretans who arrived at Kirrha, the port of Delphi, accompanied by the god in the form of a dolphin. This myth survived in plays presented during the various Delphic festivals, such as the Septerion, the Delphinia, the Thargelia, the Theophania and, of course. the famous Pythia, which celebrated the death of Python and comprised musical and athletic competitions. <br>The earliest finds in the area of Delphi, which date to the Neolithic period (4000 BC), come from the Korykeion Andron, a cave on Parnassos, where the first rituals took place. The remains of a Mycenaean settlement and cemetery were discovered within the sanctuary, but traces of occupation are rare and very fragmentary until the eighth century BC, when the cult of Apollo was established and the development of the sanctuary and the oracle began. The first stone temples of Apollo and Athena, who was also officially venerated under the name of 'Pronaia' or 'Pronoia' and had her own sanctuary, were built towards the end of the seventh century BC. According to literary and archaeological evidence other gods were associated with the sanctuary; these included Artemis, Poseidon, Dionysus, Hermes, Zeus Polieus, Hygeia and Eileithyia. <br>The sanctuary was the centre of the Amphictyonic League, an association of twelve tribes of Thessaly and the Sterea (south-central Greece), with religious and later political significance. The Amphictyonic League controlled the operation and finances of the sanctuary, as it designated its priests and other officials chosen from among the inhabitants of Delphi. In the sixth century BC, under the League's protection and administration, the sanctuary was made autonomous (First Sacred War), it increased its territory and political and religious influence throughout Greece, and reorganised the Pythian Games, the second most important games in Greece after the Olympics, which were held every four years. <br>Between the sixth and fourth centuries BC, the Delphic oracle, which was regarded as the most trustworthy, was at its peak. It was delivered by the Pythia, the priestess, and interpreted by the priests of Apollo. Cities, rulers and ordinary individuals alike consulted the oracle, expressing their gratitude with great gifts and spreading its fame around the world. The oracle was thought to have existed since the dawn of time. Indeed, it was believed to have successfully predicted events related to the cataclysm of Deukalion, the Argonaut's expedition and the Trojan War; more certain are the consultations over the founding of the Greek colonies. It was the oracle's fame and prestige that caused two Sacred Wars in the middle of the fifth and fourth centuries BC. In the third century BC, the sanctuary was conquered by the Aetolians, who were driven out by the Romans in 191 BC. In Roman times, the sanctuary was favoured by some emperors and plundered by others, including Sulla in 86 BC. <br>The rise of the Rationalist movement in philosophy in the third century BC, damaged the oracle's authority, yet its rituals continued unchanged into the second century AD, when it was consulted by Hadrian and visited by Pausanias. The latter's detailed description of the buildings and more than three hundred statues has greatly contributed to our reconstruction of the area. The Byzantine emperor Theodosius finally abolished the oracle and the Slavs destroyed the precinct in 394 BC. With the advent of Christianity, Delphi became an episcopal see, but was abandoned in the sixth-seventh centuries AD. Soon after, in the seventh century AD, a new village, Kastri, grew over the ruins of the ancient sanctuary, attracting in modern times several travellers interested in antiquities. <br>Archaeological research in Delphi began in 1860 by Germans. In 1891, the Greek government granted the French School at Athens permission for long-term excavations on the site. It is then that the village of Kastri was removed to allow for the so-called 'Great Excavation' to take place. The Great Excavation uncovered spectacular remains, including about three thousand inscriptions of great importance for our knowledge of public life in ancient Greece. Today, the Greek Archaeological Service and the French School at Athens continue to research, excavate and conserve the two Delphic sanctuaries. Of all the monuments, only the Treasury of the Athenians had enough of its original building material preserved to allow for its almost complete reconstruction. The project was financed by the City of Athens and carried through by the French School in 1903-1906. The Chiot altar, the temple of Apollo and the Tholos were also partially restored. In 1927 and 1930, the poet Angelos Sikelianos and his wife, Eva, attempted to revive the Delphic idea and make of Delphi a new cultural centre of the earth, through a series of events that included performances of ancient theatre.<br>The archaeological site of Delphi includes two sanctuaries, dedicated to Apollo and Athena, and other buildings, mostly intended for sports. Visitors arriving from Athens first encountered the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia - that is, ?Athena who is before the temple? (of Apollo). Outside its walls spread the settlement of Delphi. Within the walls were the famous Tholos, the symbol of Delphi today, and the remains of three temples dedicated to the goddess. The two earlier temples were built of tufa on the same location. These date to the middle of the seventh century and to c. 500 BC. The third temple, made of limestone, was built at the west end of the sanctuary after the earthquake of 373 BC. This sanctuary also includes the altars of Zeus Polieus, Athena Ergane, Athena Zosteria, Eileithyia and Hygeia, the remains of two buildings dedicated to the cult of the local heroes Phylakos and Autono?s, who routed the Persians from Delphi, and two treasuries with marble roofs, one Doric and the other Aeolian. The Aeolian Treasury of Massalia preserves a characteristic palm-leaf capital. Finally, the sanctuary included a memorial to the routing of the Persians, a statue of Emperor Hadrian, and a building known as the ?house of the priests?. <br>To the northwest of the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia lay the gymnasium, a place for exercise and learning, the palaestra and the baths. Further up the slope was the Castalian spring, the sacred spring of Delphi, were travellers quenched their thirst after a long voyage and purified themselves before consulting the oracle. <br>The central, most important part of the site was the sanctuary of Apollo, which was surrounded by the usual peribolos, or enclosure wall, with a main gate at its southeast corner. From here visitors entered the Sacred Way, the street that led to the temple of Apollo with its famous adyton, where Pythia delivered her oracles. With the temple and the Sacred Way as its centre, the sanctuary grew larger, spreading over artificial terraces supported by monumental walls, bordered by porticoes (of Attalus, of the Aetolians, of the Athenians) and accessed through corresponding gates in the enclosure wall. Scattered among these buildings and along the Sacred Way were numerous votive monuments dedicated by Greek cities or wealthy individuals on the occasion of socio-political events, or simply to express gratitude to the god and his oracle. These monuments are representative of artistic achievement from the East to the coasts of the Mediterranean and indicate the wealth of their patrons. They vary from bronze and silver tripods (one of the oracle's symbols) to complex groups of sculptures in bronze or marble. The luxurious and impressive, however small, votive buildings known as treasuries were used for storing smaller votive offerings, but above all for displaying the art and splendour of the city which commissioned them. The imposing temple of Apollo dominated the sanctuary from atop a large terrace supported by a remarkable polygonal wall. In front of its entrance visitors could admire a series of impressive votive monuments dedicated mostly by wealthy individuals.

Oed. tyr. 734). <br>The city goes back to the Mycenaean period and is mentioned by Homer (Il. 2.520). In the Median wars Daulis was burned by the Persians as were the nearby cities of Panopeus and Lilaia. In 395 the Thebans failed to seize the city (Hell. Oxy. 18 (13). 6) although they sacked the whole region; then in 346 it was destroyed by Philip (Paus. 10.3.1). In 220 the Aitolians tried in vain to recapture Ambrysos and Daulis (Polyb. 4.25.2) which they had lost about 225, and in 198 Flamininus seized the city from Philip V (Livy 32.18.7). <br>Daulis was built on a table-shaped acropolis (468 m high). Its ramparts, which are well preserved, were quadrangular and built of polygonal masonry, and rendered the city almost impregnable (Livy 32.18; cf. Paus. 10.4.7). Daulis had a Sanctuary of Athena, a cult of Athena Soteira, for which there is epigraphical evidence, and a Sanctuary of Isis. Inside the acropolis is the Church of Haghii Theodori, built with the reused ancient stones. <br>Daulis is not to be confused with Daulis in Epeiros. (Y.

The Phokian king Schedios resided there (Hom. Il. 17.306); Epeios, builder of the Trojan Horse, was son of the eponymous hero Panopeus (Od. 8.493-5; Il. 23. 665); and Mycenaean remains have been found on the acropolis. <br>Pausanias found the site a wretched hamlet (no administrative buildings, gymnasium, theater, agora, or fountains, very poor houses). He was, however, shown the burial mound of Tityos, and a mudbrick shrine of Prometheus, near which lay two huge stones, said to be remains of the clay from which Prometheus molded mankind. He was impressed by the city walls, which are still imposing, especially on the S side of the hill. The curtains stand as high as 5 to 6 m; one tower, with its screen-wall partly intact, is ca. 9 m high; and in Dodwell's day some doors and windows of tower-chambers were preserved. These walls like others in Phokis, must be later than the destruction of 346 (during the Third Sacred War).

Akontion, which plunges like a javelin (whence its name) into the former Lake Kopais. <br>Inhabited from Neolithic times, the site became one of the most influential Mycenaean cities. It was the capital of the Minyans, a half-legendary people from the Thessalian seaboard, and its authority spread over the whole of the Kopaic basin and possibly as far as Thebes. The legends that sprang up about it (the buildings of Agamedes and Trophonios), its great engineering achievements (the first draining of the Kopais, erection of fortresses such as Gla), and its original pottery (the gray or yellow Minyan ware) all are proof that a brilliant civilization flourished there from the 15th to the 12th c. B.C. Its place was gradually won over by Thebes and it joined the Boiotian League in the 7th c. Allied with Sparta against Thebes at Koroneia (395) and Haliartos (394), it was destroyed by the Thebans in 364 B.C. Restored by the Phokaians in 353, again destroyed by Thebes in 349 Orchomenos was rebuilt by Philip II and Alexander and became one of the leading cities of the Boiotian League from 338 onward. Sulla fought Archelaos and Mithridates' army there in 86 B.C. Under the Empire the city rapidly fell into a decline. <br>The finds are divided between the Museum of Chaironeia and those of Thebes and Athens. <br>Throughout the centuries the different cities sprang up at the E foot of Mt. Akontion and on its E and NE slopes. On the E foothills of the hill Schliemann discovered the 'Treasury of Minyas,'; a Mycenaean cupola tomb with a dromos. In the arched tholos is the gateway to the funerary chamber. In the middle of the tholos are the remains of a great funerary monument of the Macedonian period. The Mycenaean city extended from the plain to the lowest terrace. A little to the N on remains of a pre-Mycenaean or Mycenaean building (about 1700-1450) are the foundations of a temple of the Geometric period. At the foot of the E slope of the acropolis, to the NE of the Treasure of Minyas, the theater of Orchomenos, probably built at the end of the 4th c. B.C., has been recently excavated. Twelve rows of seats are preserved; proedria seats have nice relief decoration. A number of bases of statues and of votive tripods have been discovered. <br>Four hundred m to the W on a second, higher terrace, a Temple of Asklepios was built in the Hellenistic period. A peripteral Doric structure (11.50 x 22 m, with six columns in front and 11 on each side), it is surrounded by remains of Classical buildings. On the terraces farther W, stretching to the top of the hill, was the Hellenistic city built by Philip II and Alexander. At the top, 230 m above the plain, is the acropolis; not much more than a large square tower, it was built after 335 B.C. In front of it is a large cistern. <br>The ramparts match the growth of the city. The oldest wall (7th c.), which is built around the bottom terrace, is in a poor state of preservation; in some places its masonry is polygonal, in others large blocks are arranged in irregular courses. Starting from the terrace of the Asklepieion, two ramparts, one to the N and the other to the S, climb up the steep slope, moving gradually closer together until they meet at the great tower on the top of the hill, which they fortify. About 2 m thick on an average, these walls have an outer facing in polygonal masonry dating from the 4th c. B.C. There are three gates, to the N and S and near the summit. Three transverse walls link the two outer ramparts: the first runs along the edge of the Asklepieion terrace to the E; the second, which has a square tower in the middle, overlooks this terrace to the W, while the third marked the upper city limit and the beginning of the hilltop fortress with its citadel. The third wall is on a level with the N and S gates. <br>At the N foot of the rocky spur below the Asklepieion and the Chapel of Hagioi Anargyroi, is the chief spring of the Melas river. This is the Akidalia or spring of the Charites, who were especially venerated at Orchomenos (the Charitesia festivals and contests). The Sanctuary and Temple of the Charites probably stood where the Convent of the Dormition (Kimisis tis Theotokou) is today; its church, built in 874 A.D., is on the site of the temple. Around the church are many inscriptions discovered at Orchomenos; the other inscribed stones have been removed to the Chaironeia and Thebes Museums. (P.

Thereafter it was autonomous in the Boiotian League. Its territory consisted of all the NE section of the Kopais up to Cape Phtelio at the foot of Akraiphia, where an inscription engraved in the rock marks the boundary of the two territories. At the end of the 4th c. Krates of Chalkis attempted to drive a tunnel to carry off the waters of the Kopais to the sea; the beginnings of galleries and a line of well-shafts are still extant. The hill of Kopai, broken off from the shore of the ancient lake, is linked to it by a raised causeway some 100 m long; it formed a peninsula in the dry season and an island in times of flood. Made of large stone blocks, the causeway was joined to a surrounding wall, part of which is preserved to the N. To the E of the road, Frazer saw a broken bit of wall 'built of rough and rather small stones';; to the W the wall was polygonal, made of roughly bonded stones of different sizes. Nothing can be seen of it today. The acropolis, on the hilltop, was Underneath the modern village; the walls of the latter contain many ancient stones, architectural blocks, and inscriptions, especially the Church of the Panagia. A 6th c. B.C. relief of an Amazon and a metric epitaph of the 5th c. are in the Thebes Museum. Kopai had a Sanctuary to Demeter Tauropolos (the bull is represented on its coins), one to Dionysos, and one to Sarapis. The necropolis is N of the causeway, on the mainland side. No excavations have been carried out at Kopai. (P.

Chalcis was throughout antiquity the chief city of Euboea. Its position, controlling the narrowest point of the Euripus channel and the principal crossing to the mainland (first bridged in 411 BC) with harbours both north and south of the city, destined it to considerable commercial importance. Little of the ancient city has survived: there are some remains from the Late Geometric period, but little is known of the exact whereabouts of the earlier Mycenaean city of the \u2018big-hearted\u2026Elephenor' and of his \u2018swift Abantes' of which Homer speaks (Iliad II, 536-540). The western shoulder of the hill of Vathrovo\u00fani, overlooking the water south of the city, was the acropolis of ancient Chalcis. Rescue excavations there for the construction of a new general hospital (scheduled to open in 2020? but closed to visitors meanwhile) revealed a substantial classical through Roman settlement and one sanctuary\/altar. <br>The city was taken in 338 BC by Philip of Macedon, who settled a garrison on the mainland side of the Euripus.  In the 2nd century BC it was largely under Roman control, and was attacked punitively in 146 BC (in the same year that Corinth was also razed by the Romans) for disloyalty during the struggle between Rome and the Achaean Confederacy. <br>In the 6th century AD, the Emperor Justinian had an innovative, movable bridge constructed on the Euripus so as to increase the ease of passage for commerce. The city appears to have maintained a discreet commercial importance throughout the Byzantine period, with the production and trade of silk becoming a new and increasinlgy important element of its economy.  In 1210 Chalcis was seized by the Venetians, who fortified it with walls and made it the capital of their kingdom of Negroponte. With considerable expense of military force the Turkish forces of Mehmet the Conqueror took the city in 1470, built their castle of Karababa over the Venetian fort, and as Egriboz became the headquarters of the Kaptan Pa\u015fa. The Venetian admiral and doge, Francesco Morosini, tried to regain the city in 1688 but had to call off his siege after four thousand of his troops had died of malaria. The city was only freed of Turkish control in 1833 when the whole island of Euboea became part of the independent Greek state. <br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=5473'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21235810'>Wikidata ID: Q21235810<\/a>","name":"Chalkis","modSource2":5,"placeID":"385236PCha","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":13205,"pleiades":540703,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Evvoia","2011LG":"Chalkideon","1997LG":"Chalkideon","pre97":"Chalkideon","mod":"Chalkida","works":107,"regionKML":"3EMed","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20190731,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a7\u03ac\u03bb\u03ba\u03b9\u03c2","concat1":"Chalkis (Euboea)","greek2":"\u03a7\u1f71\u03bb\u03ba\u03b9\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2361531,"PHIsearch":"\u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/540703","webPageData":21971,"work_id":2,"placeid":1487,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.564800000000001745092959026806056499481201171875,38.4568000000000012050804798491299152374267578125]},"properties":{"pk":1488,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":20,"priority":4,"ModSource":1,"latitude":38.4568000000000012050804798491299152374267578125,"longitude":23.564800000000001745092959026806056499481201171875,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u1f59\u03c1\u1f77\u03b1 - Hyria, Archaic to Late Antique settlement near Tseloneri in Euboia Central Greece","concat2":"Hyria (Euboea) 20 Tseloneri - \u03a5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"Located on the E coast of Boeotia and inhabited throughout the Bronze Age.

The island has three distinct geographic zones, each supposed to have been originally settled by different groups of colonists from Thessaly: \u2018Ellopians' in the north, \u2018Abantes' in the centre and west, and \u2018Dryopes' in the south.  It was only later, at the turn of the 1st millennium BC that Ionians from Attica, Aeolians from Phthiotis, and Dorians from the Peloponnese are said to have arrived. Although a number of cities emerged in later Antiquity at different points on Euboea, the north of the island was always dominated by the city of Histiaia-Oreos, the centre of the island by the rich and important cities of Eretria and Chalcis, and the south by Karystos. Located between Eretria and Chalcis is Lefkandi \u2013 a highly significant site occupied from the Early to Late Helladic and Geometric periods.  As well as yielding the largest building yet known to us from the 10th century BC in Greece, Lefkandi and its unusual finds have notably amplified our previously scant knowledge of the culture of the so-called \u2018Dark Age' in Greece. <br>Both Eretria and Chalcis founded their own colonies on the coasts of Macedonia, Thrace, Italy and Sicily, as well as in the islands of the Aegean.  They were also leading participants in the Greek emporion at Al Mina in Syria. At home they were in constant competition as rivals for the possession of the fertile Lelantine Plain which extended between them.  At the end of the 6th century BC, when Chalcis allied itself with Boeotia against Athens in a failed attempt to restore Hippias, the exiled tyrant of Athens, retribution was swift to follow: the Athenians crossed the Euripus strait in 506 BC, defeated the Chalcidians and divided their land up between 5,000 clerurchs (Herodotus, Hist. V, 77).  Although later rebuilt, Eretria never fully recovered her former power after the Persians attacked and burned the city in 490 BC and enslaved its inhabitants in retaliation for its support of the Ionian revolt. <br>It was off the north coast of Euboea near Cape Artemision, that Greek ships boldly attempted to delay Xerxes's advance into Greece in July of 480 BC, and successfully separated his navy from his land forces for a short period. In the same campaign, a number of Persian ships were also lost in bad weather in the treacherous waters of the Kaphireas Strait, off the island's south coast.  After the Persian wars, the whole of Euboea became subject to Athens and was a member of the Delian League.  In his Peloponnesian War (VIII. 96), Thucydides deemed Euboea of \u2018greater value to Athens than Attica itself'. <br>For a very short period after 378 BC, the Athenians persuaded most of the Euboean cities to join their new maritime league.  But with the ascendancy of Boeotian power in the wake of its defeat of Sparta at the battle of Leuktra in 371 BC, the island came under the control of Thebes.  In 358 BC it was liberated by the Athenian general, Chares, who restored the island's alliance with Athens.  Twenty years later, after the battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, the island fell under Macedonian control.  It was in this period that Aristotle fled from Athens to settle in Chalcis, and died after a brief sojourn in 322 BC.  The Romans first moved into Euboea in 199 BC, capturing first Histiaia and then Eretria the following year.  By 196 BC the whole island had been taken from Macedonian control by the Roman general Titus Quinctius Flamininus, who declared it free.  The two cities of Aedipsos and Karystos appear to have flourished in Imperial times, the latter principally on its favoured marble quarries; but Chalcis, though diminished in importance, remained the island's chief city. <br>Notices from Byzantine Euboea are sufficient only to show that Byzantium had to struggle to maintain control of the island.  The city of Chalcis was still clearly a busy and productive enough port to attract the attention of the Saracen emir of Tarsus, who sailed across the Aegean at the end of the 9th century with the intention of sacking the town, but was defeated and killed by a detachment of Byzantine troops.  In 1147 Roger II of Sicily appears to have used his army to kidnap the silk-workers of Chalcis; and the island's coasts were plundered not long after by the navy of William I \u2018The Bad', king of Sicily, fresh from a victory over the Byzantine forces of John Dukas in 1159.  In the wake of the 4th Crusade, the island had originally been taken by Jacques d'Avesnes in 1205.  When he died without heirs, it was divided in 1209 into the three baronies (called \u2018triarchies') of Chalcis, Karystos and Oreos, which owed allegiance to the Frankish \u2018king of Salonica',  Boniface of Monferrat.  The baronies were subdivided latterly into smaller fiefdoms held by Frankish nobles who controlled small areas of the island from their fortified towers.  The 14th century saw a concerted and increasing Venetian domination of the ports of the island, and by 1366 the Venetians were effectively masters of almost the whole of Euboea. Their name for the island was \u2018Negroponte',  a fanciful variant of \u2018Egripo' \u2013 itself a corruption of \u2018Euripo' or \u2018Evripo', the name of the channel separating the island from the mainland at Chalcis. Under the Venetians, Negroponte ranked as a kingdom, and its standard was one of the three hoisted in St Mark's Square \u2013 symbolic of the importance which the island had to Venice as a principal centre of influence and control in the Aegean area. <br>In July 1470 the Ottoman forces of Mehmet the Conqueror laid siege to Chalcis and, not without difficulty, wrested the city and control of the island from Venice.  The island thenceforth came under the immediate rule of a Kaptan Pa\u015fa, or high admiral of the Ottoman Empire.  After the War of Independence, Euboea passed to Greece in 1833. It was in this period that the prominent British Philhellene, Edward Noel, purchased the lands around Prokopi in Northern Euboea from a departing Ottoman official \u2013 a policy originally promoted by the Government of Kapodistrias to encourage the management of rural areas and to prevent depopulation.  In similar fashion, a certain number of Moslems, nearly all of whom were ethnic Albanians, were permitted by special decree to remain on the island.  In practice much of the southern and central part of the island had historically received Albanian settlers, a policy initiated in the 15th century by the Venetians.  <br>Although by the early 20th century Euboea had become a backwater supplying timber and building materials to Athens, the development of mining created employment and led to a measure of industrialisation. There was bitter resistance to the Axis Occupation, and strong support for the popular forces of ELAS (the Ellinikos La\u00efkos Apeleftherotikos Stratos or \u2018Greek People's Liberation Army') and the Democratic Army in the mountains during the Civil War period between 1944 and 1949. Northern Evia was controlled by ELAS as early as June 1943.  In the summer of 2007 the central southern area around Styra, and some areas further north, were devastated by forest fires.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q173096'>Wikidata ID: Q173096<\/a>","name":"Euboia","modSource2":5,"placeID":"385239IEub","timePer":"M","travelogues":9947,"pleiades":543705,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Evvoia","2011LG":"Dirphyon-Messapion","1997LG":"Dirphyon","pre97":"Mistrou","mod":"Evia","works":155,"regionKML":"2Emed","styleID":"Region2","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"orange","2014EPKA":"\u0395\u03cd\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1","concat1":"Euboia (Euboea)","greek2":"\u0395\u1f54\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u0395\u03c5\u03b2\u03bf","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/543705","webPageData":41413,"work_id":2,"placeid":1490,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.111299999999999954525264911353588104248046875,38.51780000000000114823706098832190036773681640625]},"properties":{"pk":1505,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":53,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.51780000000000114823706098832190036773681640625,"longitude":28.111299999999999954525264911353588104248046875,"confidence":"High","description":"\u1f1d\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 - Hermus, river, the modern Gediz in Asia Minor","concat2":"Hermus R.

Both cities prospered because of their privileged location between two major roads connecting Thessaly to southern Greece. Of all the cities in this region (Haradra-Mariolata, Lilaia-Kato Agoriani, Erochos-Polydroso, Drymaia-Glounista, Amfikleia-Dadi), Lilaia was renown for its abundant water supply, connected since antiquity with the springs of the river Kifissos. In fact, the city was named after the nymph Lilaia, daughter of the deified river. The 'Catalogue of Ships' in Homer's Iliad (B, v. 523) mentions the city in association with the springs of the Kifissos, and Homer's hymn to Apollo records that the beautiful waters of the Kifissos spring from Lilaia and flow before the city. The city's inhabitants also believed that the water of the Kastalia spring at Delphi was a gift from the Kifissos; they placed sweets inside the water on several occasions and believed that these would emerge in the Kastalia. Lilaia is mentioned by Strabo (9.407), Pausanias (10.3.3-5), Ptolemy (3.14.14), and Pliny (Nat. Hist. 4.27). <br>The earliest traces of habitation in the area date to the Early Helladic period. After the Phocean cities were destroyed by Philip II of Macedon in 346 BC, the city of Lilaia was joined to the neighbouring city of Erochos, which occupied the Agios Vasilios hill and the area of the cemetery of modern Polydroso. Lilaia's fortifications probably date to the period of reconstruction of the Phocean citadels, in the years following Philip II's reign. Traces of early fortification walls, which may pre-date the city's destruction by Philip II, survive at the top of the acropolis.<br>The archaeological site of Lilaia and Polydroso includes the fortification walls, a fountain house, and the remains of a temple. The most beautiful springs of the Kifissos river still lie in this region. The Lilaians built a shrine dedicated to the river god near the spring of Agia Eleousa at Polydroso, and presented him with lavish offerings. Several architectural elements, such as architraves, triglyphs, and column drums, and the imposing retaining wall, which supported the temple, survive. The churches of Agios Christoforos and Agia Eleousa, which replaced the ancient cult buildings during the Early Byzantine period, used an abundance of ancient building materials. <br>Lilaia's imposing fortifications, which date to the fourth century BC, stand near the church of Agia Eleousa. Several rectangular towers reinforced the walls of trapezoidal masonry, which still stand to a substantial height; the distinctive middle tower at the very top of the acropolis controls the entire valley of the upper Kifissos. Sections of the ancient fortification wall were reconstructed and added to during the Frankish period (thirteenth-fourteenth centuries). <br>A rural shrine dedicated to Demeter, excavated by Christos Carouzos in 1928 and 1934, lies in the region controlled by Erochos. The sanctuary has a square ground plan and comprised a square terrace, on top of which stood a possible temple or altar, entered through a propylon with staircase. Finds from the shrine indicate that it was used from the Late Archaic until the Hellenistic period.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1267602'>Wikidata ID: Q1267602<\/a>","name":"Lilaia","modSource2":2,"placeID":"386225PLil","timePer":"CHR","travelogues":14382,"pleiades":540915,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Fokida","2011LG":"Delphon","1997LG":"Parnassou","pre97":"Lilaias","mod":"Kato Agoriani\/Pyrgos","works":12,"regionKML":"CentGrC4","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039b\u03af\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1","concat1":"Lilaia (Phokis)","greek2":"\u039b\u1f77\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1","iDAIGAZ":2287040,"PHIsearch":"\u039b\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/540915","webPageData":22755,"work_id":2,"placeid":1519,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.699999999999999289457264239899814128875732421875,38.60000000000000142108547152020037174224853515625]},"properties":{"pk":1522,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":715,"priority":2,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.60000000000000142108547152020037174224853515625,"longitude":22.699999999999999289457264239899814128875732421875,"confidence":"High","description":"\u03a6\u03c9\u03ba\u1f77\u03c2 - Phokis, ancient region and people in Phthiotida Central Greece","concat2":"Phokis region (Central Greece) 715 Phokida - \u03a6\u03c9\u03ba\u03af\u03c2","featureTypes":"region\/people","icon":"region1.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2637650'>Wikidata ID: Q2637650<\/a>","name":"Phokis","modSource2":12,"placeID":"386227RPho","timePer":"","travelogues":13190,"pleiades":541048,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Fthiotida","2011LG":"Amphikleias-Elateias","1997LG":"Tithoreas","pre97":"Kato Tithoreas","mod":"Phokida","works":121,"regionKML":"2Emed","styleID":"Region1","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"orange","2014EPKA":"\u03a6\u03c9\u03ba\u03af\u03c2","concat1":"Phokis region (Central Greece)","greek2":"\u03a6\u03c9\u03ba\u1f77\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2362297,"PHIsearch":"\u03a6\u03c9\u03ba\u03b9","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/541048","webPageData":"","work_id":2,"placeid":1522,"count":3}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.9054000000000002046363078989088535308837890625,38.59609999999999985220711096189916133880615234375]},"properties":{"pk":1527,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":27,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.59609999999999985220711096189916133880615234375,"longitude":22.9054000000000002046363078989088535308837890625,"confidence":"High","description":"\u1f59\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 - Hyampolis?, Classical to Roman polis near Exarkhos, formerly Bogdanou in Phthiotida Central Greece","concat2":"Hyampolis (Phokis) 27 Exarkhos (Bogdanou) - \u03a5\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlement.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1534902'>Wikidata ID: Q1534902<\/a>","name":"Hyampolis?","modSource2":12,"placeID":"386229PHya","timePer":"CHR","travelogues":"","pleiades":540820,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Fthiotida","2011LG":"Lokron","1997LG":"Atalantis","pre97":"Exarchou","mod":"Exarkhos (Bogdanou)","works":15,"regionKML":"CentGrC4","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a5\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2","concat1":"Hyampolis (Phokis)","greek2":"\u1f59\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2296351,"PHIsearch":"\u03a5\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/540820","webPageData":23112,"work_id":2,"placeid":1527,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.992000000000000881072992342524230480194091796875,38.6520000000000010231815394945442676544189453125]},"properties":{"pk":1529,"Z_ENT":5496,"Z":"","hits":67,"priority":4,"ModSource":1,"latitude":38.6520000000000010231815394945442676544189453125,"longitude":22.992000000000000881072992342524230480194091796875,"confidence":"Medium","description":"\u1f48\u03c0\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 - Opous, Archaic to Late Antique polis, near Atalandi in Phthiotida Central Greece","concat2":"Opous (East Lokris) 67 Atalandi - \u039f\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"Capital of Opuntian Locris.

On the coastal Pyrgos hill parts of the settlement's fortification, with towers and sites of gateways around a Medieval tower, are preserved.<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=5496'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q771434'>Wikidata ID: Q771434<\/a>","name":"Opous","modSource2":1,"placeID":"386230POpo","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":"","pleiades":540986,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Fthiotida","2011LG":"Lokron","1997LG":"Atalantis","pre97":"Atalantis","mod":"Atalandi","works":34,"regionKML":"CentGrC4","styleID":"PolisLow","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039f\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2","concat1":"Opous (East Lokris)","greek2":"\u1f48\u03c0\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u039f\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/540986.stoa.org, modified by ToposText:JBK","webPageData":23120,"work_id":2,"placeid":1529,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.03999999999999914734871708787977695465087890625,38.64999999999999857891452847979962825775146484375]},"properties":{"pk":1532,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":316,"priority":3,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.64999999999999857891452847979962825775146484375,"longitude":23.03999999999999914734871708787977695465087890625,"confidence":"Medium","description":"\u039b\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03af  \u1f48\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 - Lokris Opuntia, ancient region and people in Phthiotida Central Greece","concat2":"Lokris Opuntia region (Phthiotis) 316 Atalandi - \u039b\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03af  \u039f\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9","featureTypes":"region\/people","icon":"region2.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3354839'>Wikidata ID: Q3354839<\/a>","name":"Lokris Opuntia","modSource2":12,"placeID":"386231ROpu","timePer":"","travelogues":11038,"pleiades":540918,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Fthiotida","2011LG":"Lokron","1997LG":"Atalantis","pre97":"Traganas","mod":"Atalandi","works":77,"regionKML":"3EMed","styleID":"Region2","dateRevised":20200513,"textColor":"orange","2014EPKA":"\u039b\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03af  \u039f\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9","concat1":"Lokris Opuntia region (Phthiotis)","greek2":"\u039b\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03af  \u1f48\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9","iDAIGAZ":2362026,"PHIsearch":"\u039f\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/540918","webPageData":"","work_id":2,"placeid":1532,"count":4}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.55499999999999971578290569595992565155029296875,38.5859999999999985220711096189916133880615234375]},"properties":{"pk":1536,"Z_ENT":3435,"Z":"","hits":17,"priority":4,"ModSource":5,"latitude":38.5859999999999985220711096189916133880615234375,"longitude":23.55499999999999971578290569595992565155029296875,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03b1\u1f77 - Aigai, lost Euboean city possibly at Kafkala mound SSE of Politika, Euboia Central Greece","concat2":"Aigai site (Euboea) 17 Politika Kafkala - \u0391\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03af","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"The road west from Kast\u00e9lla, skirts the coast and heads towards the attractive village of Politik\u00e1 (20.5 km), considered by some scholars to be the site of ancient Aigai below the southeastern slope of the Mount Kandili massif.

Kynos overlooks not only a vital land route but it also dominates upon an important sea route on the north Euboean gulf. It sems that the hill was formed by the debris of successive occupations. Excavations in its NW sector proved that the site was constanly used from the Final Neolithic (4300-3200 B.C) to the Early Byzantine period (5th - 6th cent. A.D). The surviving architectural remains are mainly dated to the Late Bronze Age (Late Helladic IIIC, 12th century B.C). A handful of Final Neolithic sherds and a number of Middle helladic cist cist graves comprising contracted skeletons and a few grave goods such as 1-2 shells, 1 spindle whorl or 1 pot point to activity prior than the Mycenaean era. Between these strata and the foundations of the superimposing Late Helladic buildings poor structural remains indicate that the earlier phases of Late Helladic are present too. The Late Helladic IIIC structures, with mud-brick walls on a dry stone socle, were part of a complex of houses with storerooms and workshops. Some contained clay bins for keeping mostly crops. Pieces of a floor of a pottery kiln, many misfired sherds and masses of slag indicate production of ceramics and metallurgical activity. The complex was destroyed by earthquake in the middle of the 12th cent. B.C. In the destruction layer of this phase sherds - mainly from craters - depicting warships and the fragments of clay models of ships or boats were collected. They offer an insight to and in some cases provide unique evidence as to Late Bronze Age sailing vessels and naval engagements. At the aftermath the structures were rebuilt or repaired and were finished with large pithoi instead of clay bins. At the end of the 12th cent. B.C. they were burnt by fire, perhaps caused again by earthqauke. The debris was leveled and modest houses were erected immediately afterwards. In their floors small cist graves were opened to recieve children. Remnants of a building of Protogeometric period (10th cent. B.C) witness for the continuity of the settlement in later times. The fortification wall crowning the hill was built in the Hellenistic period. In the period of the Roman occupation the surface layers were releved and the contemporaneous structures were erected on top of the Mycenaean ones. The Early Byzantine period is further confirmed by architectural remains and movable finds.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5200184'>Wikidata ID: Q5200184<\/a>","name":"Kynos","modSource2":2,"placeID":"387231PKyn","timePer":"BGACHRL","travelogues":"","pleiades":540896,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Fthiotida","2011LG":"Lokron","1997LG":"Daphnousion","pre97":"Livanaton","mod":"Pyrgos\/Livanates","works":11,"regionKML":"CentGrC4","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Kynos (East Lokris)","greek2":"\u039a\u1fe6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2361973,"PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/540896","webPageData":29389,"work_id":2,"placeid":1564,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.0634000000000014551915228366851806640625,38.6734000000000008867573342286050319671630859375]},"properties":{"pk":1565,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":4,"priority":5,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.6734000000000008867573342286050319671630859375,"longitude":23.0634000000000014551915228366851806640625,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 - Kalliaros, Classical to Hellenistic settlement near Skala Atalandis? in Phthiotida Central Greece","concat2":"Kalliaros (Phthiotis) 4 Skala Atalandis? - \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"","name":"Kalliaros","modSource2":12,"placeID":"387231UKal","timePer":"CH","travelogues":"","pleiades":540847,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Fthiotida","2011LG":"Lokron","1997LG":"Daphnousion","pre97":"Livanaton","mod":"Skala Atalandis?","works":4,"regionKML":"CentGrC5","styleID":"SettlementLow","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Kalliaros (Phthiotis)","greek2":"\u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/540847","webPageData":29367,"work_id":2,"placeid":1565,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[21.489999999999998436805981327779591083526611328125,38.39999999999999857891452847979962825775146484375]},"properties":{"pk":1591,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":10,"priority":5,"ModSource":12,"latitude":38.39999999999999857891452847979962825775146484375,"longitude":21.489999999999998436805981327779591083526611328125,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u1f6c\u03bb\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 - Olenos, unlocated town between Pleuron and Kalydon possibly near Ag.

A small hill (80 masl) juts out towards the sea, the foot of which is traversed by the National Road Thessalonike-Athens. Here the distance between the mountain and the sea narrows. The hill (80 masl) is steep on all sides, except on the south, where it is connected to the ridge by a saddle. It affords extensive views over the plain of Longos to the northwest and the promontory of Arkitsa to the northeast <br>The flat-topped hill (165 x 70 m) is commonly identified with the acropolis of ancient Alope on the basis of Strabo (9. 4. 3). Gell (1819, 233), Pouqueville (1826, 156) and Lolling (1989, 307) visited the site and first suggested the identification with  Alope, which is now commonly accepted. Field observations have confirmed the presence of material remains on the surface, e.g. traces of the circuit wall with stretches of polygonal and ashlar masonry, and a scatter of many sherds and tiles, suggesting continuous habitation from the early Bronze Age until late Roman period (Fossey 1990, 92). At several places deep trenches have recently been opened up illicitly. These have exposed what appears to be an architectural structure within the circuit, now reduced to a pile of rubble.... <br> During 1995-1997, in the course of construction of an asphalt road on the south side of the National Road, and approximately 500 m northwest of the acropolis proper, the Greek Archaeological Service exposed a good portion of what is thought to have been the lower city. The salvage excavation revealed the presence of a residential quarter enclosed by the northeast corner of its newly built ashlar fortifications dated to the early Hellenistic period (Bouyia 2000a, 51-53; 2002, 29-32). 84, 20 m. of the north and 17 m. of the east fortification walls were exposed. A city gate (3 m. wide) interrupts the north wall at its westernmost end. In addition, 500 m northeast of the acropolis, 27 graves were excavated dating from the Archaic to late Hellenistic-early Roman period (Bouyia 2002, 32-34; 2006, 83-102; Dakoronia 2003, 437-440). At the same location, during the Late Roman period a building, possibly a villa, was erected, which is arguably associated with the early Christian basilica situated ca. 30 m. to the northeast. Furthermore, Bouyia (2002, 30) reported several late Roman graves and a built tomb located on top of, and next to, the north fortification wall, a clear indication that by this time the lower city had been abandoned. The ample use of spolia, i.e.  conglomerate blocks probably taken from the Hellenistic fortification walls, for the construction of the basilica and its associated building further supports this. ... <br>The search of the circuit wall on the acropolis is especially unrewarding on account of the heavy vegetation covering the remains (Fig. 3.2).  At certain places along the edge of the hill, a few small stretches of polygonal and ashlar walling mark the course of what most certainly was a fortified enclosure. Upon his visit to the site, Lolling was able to observe only the latter, since he concluded that the entire circuit was constructed of ashlar masonry. He most certainly saw the stretches located on the south and the southeast side of the circuit, as did indeed  Fossey (1990, 91). 258 This stretch is built on a slope, with the earth exerting considerable pressure upon its inner face. In addition to exposure to the elements, this is also a contributing factor for the current dilapidation of this section of the circuit. <br>The wall was built with ashlar blocks of reddish conglomerate of varying dimensions.259 The surface treatment of the blocks reveals traces of tooled work, whereas the joints show no attempt towards producing beveled edges and drafted margins (Fig. 3.3). The level surface on top gives the appearance of a stone socle that probably served to support mudbrick superstructure. ...\"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16482781'>Wikidata ID: Q16482781<\/a>","name":"Alope","modSource2":6,"placeID":"388229PAlo","timePer":"ACH","travelogues":"","pleiades":540621,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Fthiotida","2011LG":"Lokron","1997LG":"Daphnousion","pre97":"Arkitsas","mod":"Ag.

The line of the fortifications running east along the north side is clear, with the base of a bastion clearly visible; to the south, the ruins (mostly walls of Hellenistic construction) are immersed in undergrowth which covers the slope down to a basin of fertile fields which would in antiquity have been a protected area of water, possibly used as a harbour and linked to the sea below the western walls of the city.

The modern settlement occupies the site of ancient Histiaea \u2013 called \u2018polystaphylos' (\u2018rich in vines') by Homer \u2013 which controlled the lucrative passage between the Euboean Gulf and the open sea.  Its strategic location led Pericles to banish the Histiaeans and install 2,000 clerurchs here in 446 BC. The city became known thenceforth as Oreos, which appears to have been previously a deme of Histiaea, on a site very close by.  After the banished Histiaeans were called back to their former city after the Peloponnesian War, the city was subsequently known by both names. Its importance grew considerably through the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, until it was destroyed by the Romans in 199 BC.  Its coinage circulated widely in the Aegean.  According to Livy, Oreos had two citadels separated by a valley, hence the modern plural \u2018Oreoi': it possessed a maritime acropolis, which dominated the port \u2013 now the site of the castle \u2013 and an inland acropolis, Oreos Apanos.  The city had fortification walls, a planned and prosperous public area, and extensive cemeteries.  As a bishop's seat since as early as the 5th century, Ore\u00ed remained the centre of Northern Euboea through Byzantine times.  A prosperous, small town existed under the Ottomans, which came under the rule of Ali Pasha, the \u201cLion of Ioannina\u201d, in the late 18th century. After his assassination in 1822, the area was important as the scene of some of the first battles in the Greek War of Independence in 1821. Modern Istiaia (4 km inland) received numerous refugees from Asia Minor.  The new settlement of Agios Georgios, 1 km south of the town, was built for them. <br>The attractively laid out town, planned in 1833 by the Bavarian architect, Georg Schumayer, probably follows the ancient street plan.  In the harbour, the submerged line of the ancient mole can be made out.  A little behind the Church of the Sotir by the shore, stands the *\u2018Bull of Orei' (late 3rd century BC) \u2013 a bold and remarkably preserved piece of Hellenistic funerary sculpture, found by the shore in 1965.  The beautiful definition of the surface \u2013 of the tail, and especially around the neck and shoulders \u2013 is achieved by extensive and sensitive use of the claw chisel.  The horns were fitted separately, and were possibly in a different material \u2013 bronze or ivory.  Nearby is a small collection of column fragments and capitals from the ancient town: other vestiges can be seen in situ in the area between the shore and the acropolis. <br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q733574'>Wikidata ID: Q733574<\/a>","name":"Histiaia","modSource2":5,"placeID":"389231PHis","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":"","pleiades":543722,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Evvoia","2011LG":"Istiaias-Aidipsou","1997LG":"Oreon","pre97":"Oreon","mod":"Oreoi","works":22,"regionKML":"CentGrC3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03b1","concat1":"Histiaia (Euboea)","greek2":"\u1f39\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u1f77\u03b1","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/543722.stoa.org, modified by ToposText:JBK","webPageData":22749,"work_id":2,"placeid":1664,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[24.568000000000001392663762089796364307403564453125,38.9069999999999964757080306299030780792236328125]},"properties":{"pk":1668,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":126,"priority":3,"ModSource":5,"latitude":38.9069999999999964757080306299030780792236328125,"longitude":24.568000000000001392663762089796364307403564453125,"confidence":"High","description":"\u03a3\u03ba\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 - Skyros, island polis with Archaic to Late Antique remains, the modern Kastro on Skyros, Central Greece","concat2":"Skyros (Sporades) 126 Skyros Kastro - \u03a3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"polis.png","modernDescr":"Skyros is large (more than 200 sq.km) and the inhabitants are few (2,700); for this reason it feels quiet, spacious and self-contained. Its geography is that of virtually two different islands: the north \u2013 fertile and densely wooded, scattered with habitation and cultivation \u2013 is like the other islands of the Northern Sporades: the south \u2013 empty, mountainous, wild and rocky \u2013 has more the landscape of a Cycladic island.  Sophocles called the island \u201cwindy\u201d; Statius called it \u201crocky\u201d; Pindar and Strabo praised its herds of goat; and the tyrant Polycrates of Samos is said to have appreciated the quality of its meat.  All these attributes are as true today as they were over two thousand years ago. <br>Achilles sojourned on the island: disguised as a girl, he was sent by his mother Thetis to the court of Lycomedes, king of Skyros, to prevent his going to the Trojan War.  Her precaution was in vain: by a subtle ploy, Ulysses uncovered the disguise and lured the hero to Troy, where he was eventually killed before the city fell.   Neoptolemos, or Pyrrhos (\u201cred-head\u201d), son of Achilles and Deidameia, daughter of Lycomedes, grew up in Skyros, and was also taken to the Trojan War by Ulysses after his father's death (Sophocles, Philoctetes, 239).  It was in Skyros that Lycomedes treacherously killed Theseus, king of Athens, who had sought asylum with him, by pushing him \u201cover a high cliff\u201d (Plutarch, Theseus, 35). <br>There are important Neolithic and Bronze Age sites on Skyros, with clear trading links to the Northern Aegean and the Troad.  The most important and best understood is Palamari, which was a flourishing centre in the late 3rd Millennium BC.  Apart from a (probably fortuitous) lacuna of evidence for settlement between 1650 and 1300 BC \u2013 the time of the heroes, Theseus and Achilles \u2013 there appears to have been significant habitation uninterruptedly through to the Geometric period, and into Archaic and Classical times.  In 476\/5 BC Cimon of Athens came to Skyros, conquered the island, enslaved the inhabitants and planted Athenian settlers (Thucydides I, 98).  An augury led him to where the bones of Theseus were buried; he had them disinterred, transported them to Athens and there buried them in state in a Her\u00f6on near to the Acropolis \u2013 thought by some to be what we call the Theseion today.  Skyros thereafter remained an Athenian clerurchy, with only brief interruptions \u2013 when it was ceded to Sparta between 404 and 394 BC, at the end of the Peloponnesian War, and again when it was held by the Macedonians between 322 and 197 BC.  It was captured by the Roman fleet in 197 BC, but was only finally taken for Rome by Sulla in 86 BC. <br>Invading Goths pillaged the island in 276 AD, and the Saracen Arabs during the 9th century. In the 4th century, Skyros was promoted to a bishopric; in 895 the Episkopi church was built, and in 960 the Church of St. George founded on the Kastro.  After the 4th Crusade of 1204, Skyros came under Frankish domination, but was returned to Greek Byzantine control in 1276.  Less than a century later, in 1354, it was taken by Giovanni Sanudo V, Duke of Naxos, and a systematic repair of the citadel's walls was undertaken by the new overlords. After the capture of Constantinople it was ceded in 1453 by Sultan Mehmet II to the Venetians, who held it for 85 years.  In 1538, the Turkish admiral, Khaireddin Barbarossa, captured the island and returned it to a subsequent three centuries of Turkish dominance, with only a brief interlude between 1770 and 1774 during the Russo-Turkish War, when the island was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Skyros participated in the Greek Independence uprising in 1821 and became part of the new Greek State, together with the other Sporades islands, in 1830.<br>The steep and dramatic site of *Skyros Chora and its acropolis is a gift of nature for any settlers seeking a safe refuge for their dwellings which could be easily defended.  The fame of its form had even reached Homer who refers to it in the Iliad (IX, 666-668) as \u2018\u03b1\u1f30\u03c0\u03cd\u03c2' (steep).  The palace of Lycomedes, where Achilles was hidden, must have been here; for whoever was \u2018king' of this castle was lord of the island of Skyros, and whoever was lord of Skyros chose this place to be the expression of that dominance.  When the 9th century bishop of Skyros, two thousand years after Lycomedes, sat enthroned in the middle of his clerics at the centre of the synthronon in the church of the Episkop\u00ed on the very same spot, he was making his power and supremacy similarly clear to his flock. <br>In addition to its natural defences, the acropolis was heavily fortified and re-fortified in different epochs.  Most visible today are the mid 13th century, Frankish fortifications (restored in 1354 by Giovanni Sanudo, Duke of Naxos) at the summit, compactly constructed in irregular stone, with no sharp angles in their course. Mainly at the south and seaward sides, but also at other points, it is clear that these early mediaeval fortifications are in turn built on top of the larger rectangular, ashlar masonry of the ancient, late 5th century BC walls.  The most visible evidence of this enceinte is what remains of the gates and towers in the lower walls (which were repaired and rebuilt in the 4th century BC).  These are visible on the east side of the acropolis, half way between the summit and the sea, and also at the north end below Plateia Brooke.  They are massively yet precisely constructed and would have been a more effective deterrent than their later mediaeval counterparts. <br>The gate to the *Kastro stands at the top of the street, surmounted by a marble lion.  Although placed by the Venetians during their 85 year presence here, this is not the customary, Venetian winged lion of St. Mark; it is probably an ancient fragment which served as a grave marker, and for this reason has no wings.  (The Kastro was extensively damaged by an earthquake in 1999, and the area and its buildings endangered.  It is due to reopen in 2015, The huge vaulted, double-chambered structure which crowns the rise to the north is a magazine erected during the Venetian occupation of the Kastro between 1453 and 1538.

Its location was strategic in antiquity, since it controlled the road connecting southern and northern Greece. Its creation in the late fourth century BC is due to the military campaigns of the Macedonian kings Demetrios Poliorketes and Cassander in Magnesia. <br>According to mythology, the city was founded by the legendary King Athamantas, whose children, Phrixos and Helle, are depicted on the city's bronze coins riding the golden ram on their journey to the Black Sea. Recent rescue excavations show that the area was continuously occupied from the Late Bronze Age to the Iron Age, and in the Archaic and Hellenistic periods. The city's long history is mostly illustrated by its cemeteries and to a lesser extent by its architectural remains. Scant remains of a ninth-eighth century BC township were identified within the limits of Hellenistic Halos. These include parts of apsidal buildings with storerooms, adjacent rubbish pits and intramural children's burials. The cemeteries of the ninth century BC are large, with numerous graves displaying various funerary practices (burials and cremations). The archaeological finds prove the township's importance and development during subsequent centuries, although its name remains unknown. Could it be Homer's Halos? <br>The Hellenistic town was founded c. 302 BC and destroyed approximately thirty-five years later, c. 265 BC, probably by an earthquake. It was not entirely abandoned, however, as squatters continued to occupy makeshift houses and buildings near the city gates until the second century BC. Bronze and silver coins dating from the mid-fourth to the second century BC, show that Halos had contacts with cities in Thessaly, Euboia, Phtiotis and Macedonia. Excavation finds indicate that its inhabitants were involved in agriculture, animal husbandry and fishing, and, to a lesser extent in hunting. <br>Remnant of the defences and dwellings stood on the plain and the nearby hill for many centuries, and were described by several travellers. However, intensive farming and quarrying of ancient building material eventually destroyed what remained. Systematic archaeological research in the area began in the 1970's and continues to this day under the Thirteenth Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities and the Dutch Archaeological Institute. In 1976 to1990, research focused on the town's topographical layout (fortifications, grid plan) and the investigation of a number of houses, while in 1990-2003 excavations revealed the town's southeast central gate, which remained in use after the destruction of the city in the mid-third century BC, and cemeteries located outside the city walls. A study for the presentation of the monuments of Halos and the construction of facilities for visitors was recently completed.<br>The archaeological site of Halos lies on either side of the national Athens-Thessaloniki highway. It consists of the Lower town, which occupies the plain, and the Upper town, which climbs the eastern slopes of a low rocky crag, the so-called Kastro. The Upper town was surrounded by walls running down the hillside in a V-shape from the summit to the corners of the Lower town defences. The peak of the Upper town triangle was occupied by a small triangular acropolis, which was accessed through a gate at the centre of the northern wall. A possible temple was excavated in the southeast sector of the Upper town, where most of the city's public buildings appear to have been located. The acropolis was later crowned by a Byzantine fortress (twelfth century AD) with elongated shape and many towers. <br>A wall approximately 4.5 kilometres long, with 117 defence towers, surrounded the Lower town forming a rectangle. The wall, which is visible on either side of the national road, is generally preserved to a height of three courses of limestone blocks except near the southeast gate were four to seven courses are preserved. Traces of the wall's upper, brick corses are still visible in places, while the maximum preserved height of the wall is 2.5 metres. The town was accessed through two main gates to the northwest and southeast, and possibly several smaller ones. Two large avenues lead from these two gates into the town and together with other streets divided the town into a regular grid of quarters and town blocks. The streets and houses have practically disappeared, but we can estimate that the Lower town had approximately 1400 houses and workshops, where 8,000-9,000 people lived. So far, six houses, several roads, workshops and kilns used in the production of terracotta vases and objects have been excavated. The simple but spacious houses had three to five rooms, storerooms and an internal courtyard. Their walls were of brick with stone foundations and the roofs had terracotta tiles. Outside the town lie the cemeteries revealed during recent excavations.<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=2694'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5643452'>Wikidata ID: Q5643452<\/a>","name":"Halos","modSource2":2,"placeID":"391228PHal","timePer":"BGACHRL","travelogues":"","pleiades":540804,"country":"Greece","region":"Thessaly","dept":"Magnisia","2011LG":"Almyrou","1997LG":"Almyrou","pre97":"Platanou","mod":"Alos","works":11,"regionKML":"Thessaly3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u0386\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Halos (Phthiotis)","greek2":"\u1f0d\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2361746,"PHIsearch":"\u0391\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/540804","webPageData":21978,"work_id":2,"placeid":1715,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.217999999999999971578290569595992565155029296875,39.14500000000000312638803734444081783294677734375]},"properties":{"pk":1719,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":9,"priority":5,"ModSource":1,"latitude":39.14500000000000312638803734444081783294677734375,"longitude":23.217999999999999971578290569595992565155029296875,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u1f48\u03bb\u03b9\u03b6\u1f7d\u03bd - Olizon, Archaic to Late Antique city and port near Ag.

The dynasty of the kingdom of Pergamon began with General Philetairos (283-263 BC) and ended in 133 BC with its surrender to the Romans on the death of the last king, Attalos III. Life continued there in Roman and Byzantine times. <br\/>The acropolis occupies an impressive crag, 335 m high, above the valley of the river Ca\u00efcus (Bakir or Bergama \u00c7ay). On it are some of the most important monuments of Hellenistic and Roman architecture. Outstanding on its summit are: the temenos with the Doric temple of Athena and stoas (the two-storey propylon of the sanctuary is exhibited restored in the Pergamonmuseum, Berlin), the library contiguous with the N stoa of the sanctuary (it housed some 200,000 works written on parchment), the complex of palaces with peristyles, cisterns and other areas. At the N edge of the acropolis are food-storage magazines and the armoury. The highest point of the acropolis is dominated by the restored Trajaneum, a Roman temple in the Corinthian order built by Emperor Hadrian (AD 117-138) in honour of his father Trajan. <br\/>The large theatre is hewn from the precipitous hillside. With a cavea that could accommodate some 10,000 spectators, it ended on a terrace surrounded by Doric porticoes with a view over the valley and out to sea. Adjacent to it is the Ionic temple of Dionysos (2nd century BC). <br\/>Left of the entrance to the site, beside the modern parking lot, are the ruins of a heroon with a court, a room for the cult of the deified kings of Pergamon and various additional buildings. The remains of the upper agora (second half of 2nd century BC), with Doric stoas, shops and a small temple dedicated to Hermes, were found just below. Opposite the agora was the famous altar of the temple of Zeus, decorated in relief with scenes of the Gigantomachy (the entire monument was taken to Berlin in 1878-1890 and reconstructed in the Pergamonmuseum, where it is exhibited). In its original position there is only a section of the high pedestal with five steps. One hundred metres E of the upper agora are the installations of a small gymnasium, in which the bath area can be seen clearly, the odeum (1st century BC) and a marble hall with niche and decorative reliefs. <br\/>On descending to the town of Bergama one reaches the middle city. Clusters of houses, the great temenos of Demeter with a temple and many altars, as well as the Doric temple of Hera with the large gymnnasium complex have been excavated. On passing through the so-called 'House of Attalos' (a two-storey building with peristyle and mosaics), one enters the lower agora with Doric stoas, a large well and shops. From the imposing gateway of Eumenes II the modern houses begin. Here the Roman Sarapeion (K\u0131z\u0131l Avl\u0131, i.e. Red Court) is impressive by virtue of its size and state of preservation. It was built of red bricks during Hadrian' s reign (AD 117-138) above a double tunnel that passes under the Selinous tributary. The Selinous is spanned by two Roman bridges (Tabak K\u00f6pr\u00fcs\u00fc and \u00dc\u00e7 Kemer K\u00f6pr\u00fcs\u00fc), which are still in use. <br\/>The Asklepieion SW of the city is dated to Hadrian' s reign. A monumental paved street with porticoes and small shops leads through a propylon to the sanctuary, where the circular temple of Zeus and Asklepios (AD 140) survives, as well as the likewise circular two-storey Therapeuterion, sanctuary of Telesphoros, with public lavatories, a fountain and wells, a library, a small theatre and Ionic porticoes in which the faithful waited. <br\/>SW of the Asklepieion are the Roman amphitheatre, the Roman theatre and the stadium of the ancient city. S of Bergama stand impressive tumuli, such as Yi\u011fma Tepe (Hellenistic) and Maltepe (Roman) with stone enclosures and chamber tombs. <br\/>The city fell into decline in Early Christian times.

The central valleys and slopes carpeted as far as the eye can see with olive trees, the unusually tranquil waters of its two sea-gulfs that flood the heart of the island like large lakes, the self-sufficiency of its stately villages, and the relative beneficence of its mountain peaks, all contribute to give the island a feel of domesticity, spaciousness and calm. In Sappho and her contemporaries, Alcaeus, Arion and Terpander\u2014all from Lesbos\u2014the island can justly consider itself to be the cradle of Ancient Greek lyric poetry and music. The hot waters of Lesbos, whether in settings historic or bizarre or intimate, are one of the island's greatest and most unusual attractions. <br>For its size and wealth in Antiquity, Lesbos has proportionately less to show in archaeological terms than its neighbours\u2014Thasos, Samothrace and Lemnos to the north, or Chios and Samos to the south. The beautiful Hellenistic mosaic floors, exhibited in the New Archaeological Museum, are for the visitor perhaps its most vivid relic. But from the Middle Ages on, the island's heritage is rich: the grandly conceived Gattilusi castles, in Mytilene and Molyvos, in particular; a number of Byzantine rural churches; important monasteries of different periods; many Ottoman buildings, religious, military and domestic; some interesting 19th century industrial architecture from the island's large olive-oil production; and\u2014most conspicuous and widespread of all\u2014the beauty and rich diversity of its villages. All have quite different architectural personalities; but all are examples of rural settlements, in which the building materials of the houses, the paved and cobbled streets, and the stone walls are at one in texture, spirit and colour with the landscape and vegetation which surround and interpenetrate their spaces, representing a historic harmony in the Greek landscape between man and nature\u2014irreplaceable and fast disappearing.<br>Myrina, Queen of the Amazons, in her conquering campaigns in the Eastern Mediterranean, seized Lesbos and \u2018founded the city of Mytilene, which was named after her sister who took part in the campaign', writes Diodorus Siculus (Bibliotheke, III. 55), intimating the origins of its conspicuously feminine history. The island's geographical situation and many harbours always made Lesbos a centre for trade and communication from earliest times. Prehistoric finds, which indicate occupation from c. 3300 BC until the end of the Mycenaean period, relate closely to those found at ancient Troy. According to Homer, Lesbos, siding with Troy, was invaded by both Achilles and Odysseus. The early inhabitants were probably Pelasgian, but in the 10th century BC the island and the mainland opposite were colonised by Aeolians under the leadership of the Penthelides clan, the last of whom was murdered in 659 BC. <br>The island was divided in Antiquity between five competing cities: Mytilene, Methymna, Pyrrha, Antissa, and Eresos. A struggle developed between Methymna and Mytilene for the leadership of the island, and although Mytilene predominated and has remained the capital, a tradition of independent resistance was fostered in the west part of the island, which was to recur at critical moments. Lesbos was governed oligarchically with increasing chaos until the statesman and lawgiver, Pittacus, considered one of the Seven Sages, calmed the island. As supreme ruler or \u2018aesymnetes' (a kind of elected dictator or referee, according to Aristotle, appointed in some of the early city states in times of internal crisis) for ten years from 589 to 579 BC, he ushered in its greatest period of prosperity and cultural importance. A large fleet and wide mercantile interests (especially in Egypt) were combined with a high standard of education and a comparative freedom for women\u2014two traditions still noticeable today. Terpander (of Antissa) the father of Greek music, and Arion (from Methymna), who invented dithyrambic poetry, had already made Lesbos famous in the 7th century, but it was with Alcaeus (of Mytilene) and Sappho (of ? Eresos), both aristocrats and opponents of Pittacus, that the island reached its cultural zenith. The 4th century BC philosopher and scientist, Theophrastus, was also from Eresos on Lesbos. <br>The islanders founded colonies in the Hellespont and in around 600 BC challenged Athens for control of her first overseas possession, Sigeum, a settlement close to Troy at the mouth of the Hellespont. In 527 BC Lesbos fell under Persian domination and was not freed until 479 BC when it joined the Athenian League. In 428 BC, soon after the Peloponnesian War started, Mytilene tried to break away with Spartan help, but the plan was betrayed by Methymna to Athens. The Mytileneans were severely punished (Thucydides, III, 36\u201350). This was the dramatic occasion when a second galley with an official reprieve was sent, after a first had left with the orders of the Athenian council for the wholesale massacre of the male population, and managed miraculously to arrive in time. In 405 BC Lesbos fell to the Spartans and thereafter changed hands frequently, being ruled by Persia, Macedonia, and the Ptolemies, until Mithridates occupied it in 88\u201379 BC, only to be ousted by the Romans. According to Suetonius, Julius Caesar \u2018won his spurs' during the Roman storming of Mytilene. The city was much favoured by Pompey. St Paul, on his way back to Jerusalem from Greece (c. 58 AD) spent a night at Mytilene before passing by Chios and Samos. By the 5th century AD Lesbos had many fine basilicas, with bishops at both Mytilene and Methymna. <br>As a Byzantine dominion, the island was used as a place of exile, notably for the Empress Irene in 809. It suffered Saracen invasions in 821, 881 and 1055, which prompted the inhabitants to leave the coast for the mountains of the interior. In 1085 it fell to Zachas, the Seljuk Turkish emir of Izmir, although Alexius Comnenus retook the island, which then remained under Byzantine control until 1128, after which it passed for a time to the Venetians. In 1204 Lesbos became part of the Latin Empire, but returned in c. 1225 to the dominion of the Byzantine Emperors who were then in exile in Nicaea. At the end of the 13th century it was devastated by Catalan mercenaries; and in 1335 the Latin army of Domenico Cattaneo, the Genoese lord of Phocaea, captured the island but was forced to surrender it again to the Emperor of Byzantium, Andronicus III, the following year. In 1354 it was given to Francesco Gattilusio, a Genoese adventurer, as a dowry when he married Maria, the sister of Emperor John V Palaeologus. The island then enjoyed a century of untroubled prosperity under the Gattilusi dynasty who established an important trading principality in the North Aegean.<br>After 12 years of paying a substantial tribute to Sultan Mehmet II, Lesbos fell to the Turks in 1462 and, despite attempts to free it by Orsano Giustiniano in 1464 and by a Frankish-Rhodian fleet in 1501, remained under Turkish domination until 1912. The island enjoyed considerable privileges in the 19th century, in spite of an orchestrated revolt in 1821. The quantity of grand, 19th and early 20th century industrial architecture around the island and large mansions in Mytilene and Plomari is evidence of the island's prosperity from olive production, leather tanning and ouzo distilling before the World Wars; and the many Ottoman remains still visible today bear witness to the islanders' innate tolerance. After 1912, when the island became part of the Greek State, Lesbos received large numbers of refugees from Asia Minor. Between 1941 and 1944 it was occupied by German forces.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q128087'>Wikidata ID: Q128087<\/a>","name":"Lesbos","modSource2":5,"placeID":"392261ILes","timePer":"M","travelogues":10840,"pleiades":550696,"country":"Greece","region":"North Aegean","dept":"Lesvos","2011LG":"Lesvou","1997LG":"Kallonis","pre97":"Kallonis","mod":"Lesbos","works":115,"regionKML":"2Emed","styleID":"Region2","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"orange","2014EPKA":"\u039b\u03ad\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Lesbos (Lesbos)","greek2":"\u039b\u1f73\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2290444,"PHIsearch":"\u039b\u03b5\u03c3\u03b2","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/550696","webPageData":41123,"work_id":2,"placeid":1758,"count":4}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.5,39.2000000000000028421709430404007434844970703125]},"properties":{"pk":1789,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":211,"priority":3,"ModSource":12,"latitude":39.2000000000000028421709430404007434844970703125,"longitude":22.5,"confidence":"High","description":"\u03a6\u03b8\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 - Achaea Phthiotis, ancient region and people in Phthiotida Central Greece","concat2":"Achaea Phthiotis region (Phthiotis) 211 Phthiotida - \u03a6\u03b8\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u0391\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2","featureTypes":"region\/people","icon":"region2.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2089144'>Wikidata ID: Q2089144<\/a>","name":"Achaea Phthiotis","modSource2":12,"placeID":"393223RPht","timePer":"","travelogues":13088,"pleiades":540585,"country":"Greece","region":"Central Greece","dept":"Fthiotida","2011LG":"","1997LG":"","pre97":"Kallitheas","mod":"Phthiotida","works":60,"regionKML":"CentGrC3","styleID":"Region2","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"orange","2014EPKA":"\u03a6\u03b8\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u0391\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2","concat1":"Achaea Phthiotis region (Phthiotis)","greek2":"\u03a6\u03b8\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2361245,"PHIsearch":"\u03a6\u03b8\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u0391\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/540585","webPageData":"","work_id":2,"placeid":1789,"count":14}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.79899999999999948840923025272786617279052734375,39.320999999999997953636921010911464691162109375]},"properties":{"pk":1797,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":19,"priority":4,"ModSource":12,"latitude":39.320999999999997953636921010911464691162109375,"longitude":22.79899999999999948840923025272786617279052734375,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae - Phylake?, Homeric polis possibly located at Persouphli\/Dervesi, Sesklo, in Magnesia Thessaly","concat2":"Phylake (Phthiotis) 19 Persouphli\/Dervesi - \u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1247052'>Wikidata ID: Q1247052<\/a>","name":"Phylake?","modSource2":12,"placeID":"393228PPhy","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":"","pleiades":541053,"country":"Greece","region":"Thessaly","dept":"Magnisia","2011LG":"Riga Pheraiou","1997LG":"Pheron","pre97":"Aerinou","mod":"Persouphli\/Dervesi","works":10,"regionKML":"Thessaly4","styleID":"PolisLow","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae","concat1":"Phylake (Phthiotis)","greek2":"\u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/541053","webPageData":29443,"work_id":2,"placeid":1797,"count":4}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.821200000000001040234565152786672115325927734375,39.27879999999999682813722756691277027130126953125]},"properties":{"pk":1798,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":8,"priority":5,"ModSource":1,"latitude":39.27879999999999682813722756691277027130126953125,"longitude":22.821200000000001040234565152786672115325927734375,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u03a0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 - Pyrasos, Archaic polis, probably at Nea Ankhialos in Magnesia Thessaly","concat2":"Pyrasos (Magnesia) 8 Nea Ankhialos - \u03a0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"settlementlow3.png","modernDescr":"Port of Thessalian Thebes and a harbour with intense mercantile activity. There was a sanctuary of Demeter and Kore (Demetrion) here. The city declined in the Late Hellenistic period (1st century BC). Many graves have been excavated in its environs.<br\/>In Early Christian times it was the largest port in Thessaly (some anchorages are visible). The Early Christian city, in its heyday from the 4th till the 7th century, extended over the coastal plain, on the site of ancient Pyrasus. It was destroyed by fire in the late 7th century. Justinian additions (6th century) to the wall that surrounded the acropolis of ancient Pyrasus can be seen. Ruins of public and private buildings (including the bishop's palace) have been uncovered, as well as nine large basilicas, near the main street of the Early Christian city, which led to the harbour. These have extensive marble and mosaic floors, and finely carved sculpted decoration. The three-aisled basilica dedicated to Saint Demetrios was the episcopal church (late 5th or early 6th century). The basilica of Elpidios is dated to the same period. That of High Priest Peter, the largest and most luxurious (earliest phase late 4th or early 5th century) was part of a major ecclesiastical complex.

The modern settlement, named Velestino, was founded in the post-Byzantine period (13th century B.C.), and has played an important role in Greek history of the laste centuries (birth place of Regas Pheraios, pioneer of the Hellenic Revolution against Turks). Today Velestino is a very active town, part of which is built upon the ancient city, fortunately not on the most important part of it.<br>The very important but very limited excavations at Pherai took place in the first quarter of the 20th century, at the temple of Zeus Thaulios, in collaboration between the Greek Archaeological Service and the French Archaeological School. Since 1977 the Ephorate of Antiquities of Volos has been operating systematic excavations of the 'acropolis' (city-fortification) and many rescue excavations at the part of the ancient city, which lies beneath the modern town of Velestino. The last ones have brought to light some monuments of great interest. Many private properties were bought recently by the Ministry of Culture, so that the systematic excavations can be continued. <br>Significant monuments or architectural groups: <br>- The acropolis. Is located at the SW side of the ancient city and includes two hills: the so-called 'Magoula Bakali', which is also a prehistoric site, and the so-called 'Aghios Athanasios' or 'Panagia' hill, where the fortification wall of the 4th century B.C. are very well preserved. <br>- The 'Hypereia Krini' (Fountain), an ancient spring, 'the water loved by the gods' (Sophocles, Frg 825 N.), is located in the center of the ancient city, where a small pond is formed along old plane trees. Ancient ruins are visible inside as well as outside the water. <br>- The temple of 'Zeus Thaulios'. One of the very few excavated ancient temples of Thessaly, is located on the north edge of the ancient city. It was a peripteral doric temple, with 6 X 6 columns, dated at the end of the 4th century B.C. Today, only the SE part of its krepis is preserved. <br>- A building with stoa dated in the Hellenistic period. It has been relealed in the NE part of the ancient city, where the Agora probably was. The doric columns of the stoa are unfinished and the lower parts of them still remain 'in situ'.<br><a href='https:\/\/chronique.efa.gr\/?kroute=report&id=4713'>Chronique des Fouilles link<\/a><br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1330631'>Wikidata ID: Q1330631<\/a>","name":"Pherai","modSource2":2,"placeID":"394228PPhe","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":13970,"pleiades":541044,"country":"Greece","region":"Thessaly","dept":"Magnisia","2011LG":"Riga Pheraiou","1997LG":"Pheron","pre97":"Agiou Georgiou Feron","mod":"Velestino","works":57,"regionKML":"Thessaly3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03af","concat1":"Pherai (Magnesia)","greek2":"\u03a6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f77","iDAIGAZ":2100752,"PHIsearch":"\u03a6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/541044","webPageData":22809,"work_id":2,"placeid":1840,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.04599999999999937472239253111183643341064453125,39.4369999999999976125764078460633754730224609375]},"properties":{"pk":1842,"Z_ENT":808,"Z":"","hits":179,"priority":3,"ModSource":12,"latitude":39.4369999999999976125764078460633754730224609375,"longitude":23.04599999999999937472239253111183643341064453125,"confidence":"High","description":"\u03a0\u03ae\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd - Pelion, (1624 m), the modern Mount Pilio in Magnesia Thessaly","concat2":"Pelion Mt.

Dodona was also known for its famous oracle, traditionally considered as the most ancient one in Greece and referred to by Homer in his epics. Herodotus (2.52) relates a myth regarding the establishment of the sanctuary, narrated to him by the sanctuary's priests on his visit to Dodona: two black pigeons, the peleiades, flew from Thebes in Egypt; one of them landed in Libya, where the temple of Ammon Zeus was subsequently erected; the other one reached Dodona, where it sat on an oak tree, Zeus's sacred tree, and spoke in a human voice, indicating the spot where the god's oracle was to be built. By observing the rustling of the leaves on the sacred oak tree and the flight of the birds nesting in it the priests interpreted the god's will. The oracles were based on the murmuring of the waters from the ancient spring and on the sound produced by bronze cauldrons standing on tripods around the sacred tree. According to ancient sources, the priests of the oracle were originally only men, but priestesses, the so-called Peleiades, appear in later times. The priests and priestesses were famous for walking barefoot and for sleeping on the ground so as to be in immediate contact with the earth. <br>Archaeological evidence suggests that the area was occupied since the Bronze Age. The earliest cult was probably dedicated to the Earth goddess or to another female deity related to fertility. The cult of Zeus, brought to Dodona by the Selloi, a tribe from Thesprotia, soon became the main cult. Zeus Naios was worshipped together with Dioni, his wife, according to local tradition. Later, the cult of Aphrodite, their daughter, was also introduced, together with that of Themis. Dioni and Themis were worshipped as 'naian gods' - that is, gods who shared the same house (synoikoi) and temple (synnaioi) as Zeus. <br>Originally the sanctuary was outdoors, and various ceremonies were performed around the sacred tree (sacred oak or fagus), in which the divine couple, Zeus and Dioni, resided. Offerings, such as bronze tripods, statuettes, jewellery, and weapons, from southern Greece reached the sanctuary as early as the eighth century BC, indicating that settlers from Greek cities were colonizing the shores of Epirus. Dodona, however, did not witness the intense building activity of other famous sanctuaries, such as Delphi, Olympia, and Delos, during this period, probably because it was isolated from the rest of Greece and far from all major commercial routes. The sanctuary remained outdoors, and the sacred area of the tree was defined by a kind of enclosure formed by bronze cauldrons. <br>The first signs of building activity date to the early fourth century BC, when the first small temple of Zeus and three Ionic stoas were erected. The enclosure of the Dodona acropolis, further north, dates to the same period. The sanctuary thrived in the third century BC under King Pyrrhus (297-272 BC), who gave it its monumental character. The rest of the temples and the sanctuary's most impressive buildings, including the theatre, the bouleuterion, the prytaneum, and the stadium, which hosted the Naian Games held in honour of Zeus, were all erected during this period. The sanctuary was destroyed by the Aetolians in 219 BC, but was soon reconstructed and functioned again until 167 BC, when it was destroyed by the Romans. It suffered again in 88 BC under Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus, and his Thracian warriors. The sanctuary was reestablished in the Roman period, although with a different character, and its theatre was converted into an arena, which Emperor Hadrian visited around 132 AD. The oracle and festivities in honour of Zeus continued to attract worshipers until the fourth century BC. Christianity, however, gradually replaced the old religion, Christian basilicas were erected inside the sacred precinct, and the sacred oak was cut down. <br>Excavations by K. Karapanos in 1875 identified the sanctuary and yielded a large number of finds. Another short-termed excavation began after 1913 by the Archaeological Society in Athens under G. Sotiriadis, but was interrupted by the political events of 1921. D. Evangelidis continued the investigations from 1929 until 1932. Systematic excavations began in the 1950s under Evangelidis and S. Dakaris, and continued under Dakaris alone after Evangelidis's death in 1959. Since 1981 excavations have been carried out under the auspices of the Archaeological Society of Athens and are co-funded by the University of Ioannina. The systematic consolidation and restoration of the theatre, stadium, and other monuments, according to a study by the architect V. Charisis, began after 1961 with funds provided by the Archaeological Society and the Programme for Public Investments. The theatre, most of which was restored by 1975 (apart from the third landing and a few other parts), now hosts theatrical performances.<br>The archaeological site of Dodona comprises the sanctuary of Zeus and the acropolis. Located at the foot of the hill, the sanctuary is surrounded by an enclosure; the acropolis occupies the hilltop. Despite its importance, the sanctuary was not heavily built up, and for many centuries worship took place outdoors, with only a simple oikos (house) serving the needs of the ceremony. Building activity increased at the end of the fourth century and particularly during the third century BC, when a number of large buildings, the remains of which are still visible, were constructed. <br>The sanctuary is defined by an enclosure, whose east section is the extension of the acropolis enclosure. The entrance was on the west section. Next to it was a Doric temple, the altar of Hercules (Building A), and two small Ionic temples dedicated to Dioni, Zeus' wife, the early temple (Building C) and the later one (Building I), built after the destruction of the original temple by the Aetolians. North of the temple of Hercules are the ruins of a basilica, which appears to have had two distinct building phases. West of these temples is the sanctuary's most important building, the Sacred House, or temple of Zeus (Building E1), a square construction with at least four building phases: the original small temple of the early fourth century BC and a number of extensions and reconstructions of the fourth, third, and second centuries BC. The temples of Themis (Building G) and Aphrodite (Building L) flank the temple of Zeus. Pausanias refers to them as 'worthy to be looked upon' (1,17,5), probably because of their central location inside the sanctuary next to the sacred oak and the main temple. North of the temple of Themis, Evangelides excavated a pillaged cist grave, whose date of construction and significance are unknown. Two unexcavated buildings, probably temples, identified southwest of the temple of Aphrodite, complete the amphitheatrical positioning of the temples towards the west. The remaining buildings in the sanctuary's west sector reflect the program of monumental reconstruction orchestrated by King Pyrrhus in the early of third century BC. These are the bouleuterion (Building E2), where the Koinon of Epirus conferred, the prytaneum (Building O), the theatre, and the stadium. The priests' residence (Building M), located between the bouleuterion and the theatre, was the sanctuary's earliest building after the Sacred House; it served as a dwelling for the priests of Zeus or for the leaders of the Koinon of Molossoi. <br>The ancient acropolis on the hilltop north of the sanctuary probably served as a permanent residence for Dodona's authorities and as a refuge for the locals in times of danger. A fortification wall was erected around the acropolis in the fourth century BC. Built in isodomic masonry and approximately 750 meters long, the wall had rectangular towers along its perimeter, particularly on the more easily accessible west and north sides. It also had three gates: a large one, which communicated directly with the theatre and the sanctuary, in its north-west section, a smaller one in the middle of the south section, and a third gate, which led into the plain of Ioannina, in its east section. The foundations of several buildings and a rock-hewn subterranean water cistern, which supplied the site with water in times of need, were identified inside the acropolis, but have not yet been investigated. Two pillars supported the cistern's ceiling, and its walls were covered with hydraulic cement.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q382317'>Wikidata ID: Q382317<\/a>","name":"Dodona","modSource2":2,"placeID":"395208SDod","timePer":"ACHRL","travelogues":9770,"pleiades":530843,"country":"Greece","region":"Epirus","dept":"Ioannina","2011LG":"Dodonis","1997LG":"Dodonis","pre97":"Manteiou","mod":"Dodoni","works":72,"regionKML":"Epirus3","styleID":"Sanctuary","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"green","2014EPKA":"\u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1","concat1":"Dodona (Ioannina)","greek2":"\u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u1f7d\u03bd\u03b1","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03c9","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/530843","webPageData":21999,"work_id":2,"placeid":1854,"count":3}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[22.106100000000001415401129634119570255279541015625,39.42219999999999657802618457935750484466552734375]},"properties":{"pk":1858,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":6,"priority":5,"ModSource":12,"latitude":39.42219999999999657802618457935750484466552734375,"longitude":22.106100000000001415401129634119570255279541015625,"confidence":"Low","description":"\u1f08\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd - Asterion?, Homeric town, identified by Stephanos of Byzantium with Peiresiai, near Ermitsi Karditsa Thessaly","concat2":"Asterion?

The cult image of Apollo Smintheus is supposed to have been fashioned by Skopas. The name Smintheus supposedly referred to the mouse that was fixed to the feet of the Apollo statue. According to Strabo there were several sanctuaries so named, located especially in Troas and on the nearby island of Tenedos. The sanctuary, i.e. the temple, in Chrysa was evidently the most important of these. <br>In 1853 the English captain Spratt discovered in the SW corner of Troas below the village then named Kulahli the remains of ancient Chrysa, at that time probably better preserved than they are now. The location is called Gulpinar today and lies at the end of a paved road 25 km long, leading W from Assos. The W coast of Troas (near the ancient Hamaxitos) is only 3 to 4 km distant, the coast of the Gulf of Edremit (Atramyttion) somewhat farther. Thirteen years after Spratt's discovery, the Society of Dilettanti commissioned R. P. Pullan to investigate the site of the Smintheion of Chrysa. In the autumn of 1866 Pullan's excavations were completed. His report appeared in 1881 (Antiquities of Ionia, IV, pp. 40ff, pls. 26-30). The plates depict not so much the state of the excavated findings as Pullan's reconstructions. In vol. 5 of the same work (1915) appeared some supplements to Pullan's publications by W. R. Lethaby (see below for further references). Since the temple edifice excavated by Pullan no longer exists and the other architectural remains have also almost all been lost, great importance has accrued to the early publication even if it no longer satisfies present-day points of view. <br>According to Pullan the Temple of Chrysa was an Ionic pseudo-dipteral structure (8 x 14 columns); the substructure of 11 steps has, however, been questioned (see Dinsmoor below, p. 272, n. 2). The stylobate was 40.4 by 22.5 m. In front of the cella to the E lay a deep pronaos or vestibule, in back, a short opisthodomos, each with two columns in antis. The narrow Ionic columns of 24 flutes stood upon an extraordinary base that represented a type of 'Ephesian-Attic'; mixed form (cf. H. C. Butler, Sardis, II, p. 114, fig. 11). The columns carried richly decorated Hellenistic capitals, one of which is still preserved. The visible parts of the building were of marble. There was in addition a decorated figure frieze (0.8 m in height) above the architrave. Pullan was not able to display the six frieze slabs in his publication. They have now for the most part been lost, along with the other remains of the temple, so that a few years ago only one complete slab in Gulpinar and a few fragments were rediscovered and could be published (see below, H. Weber). Depicted are a two-horse chariot with driver and two other persons, two battle scenes between armed men, and single male and female figures, which unfortunately have recently become detached from the relief. <br>To judge from the building ornamentation and the style of the frieze, the temple was constructed ca. 200 B.C. or in the early 2d c. Accordingly the cult image by Skopas (see below, Grace and Lacroix) must have been carried over from an older edifice into the later Hellenistic temple. <br>The building remains that can still be seen in the valley below the village of Gulpinar consist partly of brick walls and could belong to the site of Chrysa seen by Strabo.

Through it ran the major routes from S Greece to Macedonia, and routes across Thessaly and to the Gulf of Pagasai. The city and the plain around it were settled in prehistoric times, and its name must be early, but it is first mentioned in connection with the aristocratic Aleuadai, whose home it was. It flourished during the 5th c. and was a considerable artistic center, but was weakened by party dissensions by the end of the century. It was the leader of the resistance against the tyrants of Pherai, but felt it necessary to call in first Thebes and then Macedon to help. In 344 B.C. Philip II of Macedon directly annexed Thessaly, and from then to 196 B.C. Larissa was under Macedonian control. It was the capital of the post-196 B.C. Roman-organized Thessalian League and flourished during the Republic and Empire. Justinian refortified the city. <br>Very few visible remains of the ancient city are left in place. The Peneios bends in a rough arc around the N side of the city. A Turkish earth embankment (still visible in places) makes a wide arc around the S side. It is supposed the Turkish wall may lie on the line of the ancient one; if so, the circuit of Larissa (counting the river) would be approximately 7 km. There are no visible remains of the city wall, however. In the NW part of the city, close to the river, is a hill (96 m) which was the ancient acropolis. It was fortified in Byzantine times. No ancient wall is to be seen. The ancient theater, which dates to the later Hellenistic period, was dug into the S side of this hill. The seats are marble, and some have the names of notables of the city carved on them. <br>East of the acropolis hill, in modern Demeter St., a large, 4th c. B.C. votive stele, dedicated to Poseidon, was discovered in situ in 1955. <br>The agora of the ancient city was probably located near the center of the modern city, S of the citadel. Here, at the crossing of Roosevelt and Papakyriazis Sts., three large Doric poros column drums, two pieces of triglyph, and other architectural fragments were discovered recently. In the area were a row of statue bases and immediately W of them a massive 4th-3d c. B.C. foundation, which has been identified as some building of the agora, or possibly the Temple of Apollo Kerdoios, which is known to have been in the lower city. Near this were some Late Roman or Early Christian foundations. In this general area, in 1910, Arvanitopoullos discovered a few curved seats and a foundation which he ascribed to an odeion and dated to the 4th c. B.C. Stahlin suggested it might have been a bouleuterion. What appear to be remains of a Classical temple lie just N of the Metropolis cathedral, N of the E end of the bridge which leads across the river to the W. Part of an Athena head and other statues of the Roman period have been found here. <br>Ca. 5 km S of the city at Palaiochori Larissis or Siiti, a Hellenistic underground vaulted chamber tomb has been excavated. At Kioski, across the river, a short way along the road leading to ancient Argura, a tomb containing two silver skyphoi was discovered. Hellenistic graves (terracotta comic masks) and a head of Dionysos were discovered at the airport SE of the city. <br>Numerous small finds, sculptures (6th c. B.C. through Roman), inscriptions giving a good deal of information about the ancient city, etc., have been found in Larissa and its vicinity. These, and objects from the Nome of Larissa are mainly housed in the local museum, a restored mosque E of the city center. Some are in the Volo Museum. (T. S.

Byz. s.v.). It was on the left bank of the Peneios river, supposed to be 40 stades (ca. 7 km) from Atrax (Strab. 9.438). This has long been considered an ancient site at a prehistoric mound (Gremnos or Gremnos Magoula) about 7 km W of Larissa, just on the left bank of the Peneios. This identification was denied by Stahlin, who placed Argura at an ancient site at Gunitza, ca. 8 km W of Gremnos Magoula, but the Gremnos-Argura identification has recently been reasserted by Franke and Milojcic. The history of the city is virtually unknown. <br> The prehistoric mound has been half carried away by the river. It served as the acropolis of the ancient city, which is otherwise in a flat plain. Excavations on the mound in 1955-58 turned up sherds from the Geometric through Roman periods as well as prehistoric. One well found in 1956 contained Classical, another early Hellenistic, pottery. A fragment of an early Classical terracotta revetment found on the mound may indicate the presence of a temple, perhaps to Artemis, to whom an inscription was found in the excavations. A test trench on the N side of the mound produced parts of two archaic-Classical buildings. Right at the river's edge below and a little to the E of the mound are a few courses remaining of a tower constructed of large rectangular blocks, which was built over the remains of an earlier one of polygonal masonry, and seems itself to have been rebuilt. It is conjectured that this was a late archaic tower rebuilt in the 4th c. B.C. From the mound the course of two concentric city walls can be seen to the NE and W, about 350-450 m away from the mound. The inner one is possibly archaic or Classical; the outer, Hellenistic. Investigations within the lower city area in 1958 turned up sherds of the 6th c. B.C. through the Hellenistic period, and some scanty remains of a public building and houses. The agora of the ancient city may have been in the flat area immediately to the E of the mound. Objects from the excavations and some found by chance are in the Larissa Museum. <br> A tumulus (Skismeni Magoula) ca. 2 km NW of Gremnos Magoula and 1 km N of the river was partially excavated in 1958-59. Under the edge of the mound were three stone sarcophagi, close to each other and radiating from the center of the mound. These were plain, and had each been lined with a wooden coffin, one of which was well preserved and contained fragments of clothing and a pillow along with the skeleton. One of the others contained a lekythos of the 4th c. B.C. No trace of a built tomb or other grave was found in the center of the mound. Between Gremnos Magoula and Skismeni Magoula was a Hellenistic necropolis on the road leading towards Gunitza. This was investigated in 1955 and 1958 and yielded a few objects. Some 70 m W-SW of the Hellenistic necropolis one of the Classical period was discovered in 1958. To the N of the road to Larissa from Gremnos Magoula, 2 km E of the mound, is a group of eight tumuli (Pente Magoules), perhaps Hellenistic grave mounds, but so far uninvestigated. By the road at this point Leake noted some ancient foundations and blocks, and a piece of a Doric column (chord of flute 6 inches). (T. S.

It was allied to Pherai, but its inhabitants were killed or sold into slavery by Alexander of Pherai in the course of his struggle with the Thessalian League (Plut. Pel. 29). Magnesia was occupied by the Macedonians under Philip II, and remained virtually Macedonian until the Roman liberation of Greece in 196 B.C. Meliboia is not mentioned as being part of the Magnetian synoecism which created Demetrias in 293 B.C. It was besieged by the Romans in 169 B.C. so as to facilitate a siege of Demetrias, but the siege was relieved (Livy 44.13). It was captured and plundered by the Romans the next year, at the time of, or after the battle of Pydna (Livy 44.46.3). The city was noted for its purple dye (Vergil Aen. 5.251; Lucr. 2.500). <br>At Palaiokastro (by Kato Polydendri) on the coast near the modern town of Polydendri (whose center is some 2 km inland) are the ruins of an ancient town. These are on a rocky hill which makes a promontory at the S end of a long beach (Agniokampos) extending from Cape Kissavos. The promontory is just S of the mouth of the river Bourboulithra. Scanty remains of the ancient city wall, apparently of good 4th c. construction, have been noted above an overgrown ravine at the S edge of the hill. Some sections of the W wall were seen by Stahlin (writing in 1931). The area of the hill enclosed by the wall must have been very small. On the end of the promontory are quarried areas and rock-cut steps. To the N and S of the point are inlets which might serve as harbors. On the hill the foundations of a large rectangular building were noted in 1957. Good black-glazed sherds have been found here. Walls of modern houses in the vicinity contain ancient blocks. A tile fragment with the name of the Meliboians stamped on it was found at the 'Kastro'; of Polydendri, apparently identical with this site (see Woodward), which makes the identification most likely. From this area came an early 5th c. B.C. marble head of a young man, and two male and one female marble torsos of the 4th c. B.C. (now in Volo). <br>About 6 km inland, W of Palaiokastro and a little N of modern Skiti there is another ancient site. This is on a high bluff to the S of and overlooking the river Potamia or Aguiokampos which flows between the masses of Ossa and Pelion. The bluff falls off steeply to W, N, and E, so the only easy access is along the neck from the S. A city wall, ca. 1,250 m in circuit, ran around the bluff. It is best preserved where it was originally strongest, on the S, where one rectangular tower is preserved; the rest of the wall is somewhat zigzagged, but was apparently built without towers. The wall is about one m thick, built of rough field stones laid in fairly regular courses, cemented with mortar. Here and there some bigger stones are incorporated. In the SW part of the enclosure are the remains of a stuccoed cistern, and Leake reported some remains of buildings. The site at Skiti controls the only practicable route from the N along the Magnesian coast and inland to Larissa or the Gulf of Pagasni. It is argued by Pritchett that the site at Palaiokastro is Herodotos' Meliboia, and the site at Skiti the Meliboia of 169 B.C. The date of the Skiti site, however, remains uncertain, although evidently late. It has been suggested that it might be Byzantine Kentauropolis, a fort said to have been restored by Justinian (Procop. De aed. 4.3.13). (T. S.

The west is rugged and Aegean; while the east is more Anatolian in feel.  The whole island is volcanic in nature and displays much of the geophysical torment of its formation.  A reef, some way out to sea from its eastern shore may even be an island mentioned by both Homer and Sophocles which, according to Pausanias, had by his time disappeared under water in an earthquake.  Given its appearance, it comes as no surprise that Lemnos was always held sacred to Hephaestus (Vulcan), the god of fire and of the forge \u2013 a fascinating divinity, born without the physical perfection of the other gods, and who was hurled down onto Lemnos from Mount Olympus during a dispute between his mother, Hera, and Zeus (Iliad, I. 590).  Hephaestus remains the hard-working and artful outsider of the Olympian pantheon; but his cult on Lemnos at Hephaistia and his association with the sanctuary of the Cabeiri (whose father he was, according to Herodotus) substantially pre-dates Greek settlement on the island.  Lemnos, with its volcanic fumaroles and its position on the routes to and from the mines and ore-deposits of the Black Sea and Anatolia, was well positioned to be one of the earliest centres of metal-working in the Aegean. As a result the island acquired importance very early on in prehistoric times.  In 1930 what is generally considered to be the oldest organised city in Europe was uncovered by Italian archaeologists at Poliochni, on the island's east coast.  And the links with Italian archaeology continue through the important \u2018Lemnos stele' \u2013 a late 6th century BC inscription in the native Lemnian language, which bears extraordinary affinities with the Etruscan language and which has altered scholarly thinking on the question of the origins of the Etruscans.  The stele is now in Athens.<br>The legends and mythology associated with Lemnos are particularly rich and important, and explain the complexity of the island's history.  From Naxos, Dionysos brought Ariadne to Lemnos, where she gave birth to his sons, among them, Thoas.  Not long after, Aphrodite punished the womenfolk of Lemnos \u2013 because they had purportedly impugned her virtue \u2013 with a lingering, unsavoury odour which prevented the men of the island from having intercourse with them.  The men took Thracian concubines from the mainland instead.  The women of Lemnos thereupon took revenge by murdering all the island's menfolk except for Thoas, now their king, who escaped through the compassion of his daughter, Hypsipyle.  A year or so later when Jason and the Argonauts put in at Myrina on their voyage to Colchis the women feared a counter-attack; but on the advice of an old woman, they received the men with hospitality, sleeping with them so as to ensure the continuity of their tribe.  Hypsipyle bore Jason twin sons, before he departed again for Colchis on his mission to find the Golden Fleece.  Diodorus Siculus (Bibliotheke, III.55 ff) furthermore says that Myrina, the queen of the warlike, female tribe of Amazons from North Africa, on her campaigns conquering lands in the Eastern Mediterranean, founded many cities.  Amongst them was \u201cone which bore her own name\u201d (there is another ancient Myrina on the coast of Asia Minor, north of Smyrna, in addition to the one on Lemnos); she also founded a city on Lesbos \u201cnamed Mytilene, after her sister\u201d.   Women are of primary importance throughout the story of Lemnos and its neighbouring islands.  An interesting epilogue is provided by another literary tradition.  It was Hercules in the end who destroyed the Amazons.  On his death he bequeathed his bow and arrows to the archer Philoctetes in gratitude for being the person designated to lighting his pyre.  Philoctetes, who was among the Greek heroes who sailed to Troy, was bitten by a snake during a stop on the journey, and the ensuing wound became gangrenous and began to smell so badly that Odysseus, on the orders of Agamemnon, abandoned him on Lemnos or on nearby Chryse.  Cured eventually of his affliction, he was later brought back to the Greek camp at Troy and was the warrior who killed Paris.  Lemnos \u2013 which in earlier days of volcanic activity may well have been a place of bad, sulphurous odours \u2013  produced a kind of sacred, medicinal clay of volcanic origin, known throughout history as \u2018Lemnian Earth' which was widely used for the curing of snake-bites.  The dense and suggestive weave of themes, recurrences and cross-references in this combination of myth, history and geography is perhaps the richest of any of the islands' stories. <br>Exploits of the sexes appear once again in the fore in a story from historic times which gave rise according to Herodotus (Hist. VI, 138) to the expression \u201cLemnian deeds\u201d, meaning \u2018atrocities'.  During the Persian Wars the Lemnians, in an act of revenge, carried off Athenian women from the Sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron in Attica and took them back to be concubines in Lemnos.  The resulting children borne by the women soon began to look down on their local half-brothers \u2013 whereupon the Lemnians slaughtered both the upstart children and their Athenian mothers.  Crops failed thereafter on the island.  When in desperation the islanders consulted the Delphic Oracle, its recommendations led eventually to the island's submission to the Athenian yoke. <br>Homer mentions that the people of Lemnos were the (\u2018wild-voiced') Sintians; Herodotus and Thucydides mention that they were Pelasgians or Tyrrhenians, indicating perhaps different stages of pre-Greek history. Whatever their identity, they were not of Greek stock in earliest times and had come to the island from the Thracian or Anatolian mainlands: the earliest Greek inscription from the island is dated to c. 500 BC. <br>Archaeology has shown that Lemnos had an advanced Neolithic civilisation and a Bronze Age culture of Minoan-Mycenaean type, connected with Troy and Lesbos, which continued without a sharp break into the Geometric period.  The island fell to Persia in 513 BC and changed hands more than once before the end of the Persian wars.  Hippias is said to have died here after Marathon.  From 477 BC the island formed part of the Delian League, paying an annual tribute of nine talents; it later had a clerurchy imposed by Athens.  It was these clerurchs who dedicated the famous Lemnian Athena of Pheidias on the Athenian Acropolis.  Lemnian troops fought for Athens at Sphacteria (425 BC), at Amphipolis (422 BC) and at Syracuse (413 BC).  Apart from brief periods of domination by Sparta (404-393 BC), by the Macedonians, and by Antiochus the Great, Lemnos remained principally under Athenian influence, and was her advance-base in the northern Aegean, along with Imbros and Skyros: although the immediate governance may have been Athenian, ultimate control was latterly exercised by Rome, until independence for the island was granted by Septimius Severus.  Both Theophrastus in the 4th century BC and Galen in the 2nd century AD visited and were interested in the properties of the island's renowned \u2018Lemnian earth'. <br>The island was plundered by the Germanic tribe of the Heruli in the late 3rd century AD, and later passed under Byzantine rule.  In 325 a bishop, Strategios, of Lemnos was present at the 1st Council of Nicaea, and the island was raised to a metropolitan see under Leo VI (886-912).  In 924 the Saracen fleet under Leo of Tripoli was defeated by a Byzantine naval force in the waters off Lemnos.  In 1136 the Venetians officially obtained their first foothold on the island at Kotsinas, and from 1207 Lemnos became the fief of the Venetian, Navigajoso family.  In the 13th to 15th centuries the island was disputed between Venice, Genoa and Byzantium \u2013 the subsequent, brief Genoese rule from 1453-5 being so harsh that the inhabitants pled with Sultan Mehmet II to liberate and rule them instead.  A papal force landed, however, the following year as part of a crusade under Callixtus III to repossess Constantinople.  A new religious order of Knights was founded on the island, along the lines of the Knight Hospitallers of St John, by Pius II; but Lemnos finally fell, following a series of disputes with the Venetians, to the Ottoman Sultanate in 1479 which later used it as a place of exile for disgraced notables.  Count Orloff's Russian force occupied the island in the war of 1770, but was driven out by the Ottoman naval commander, Hassan Bey.  For a few months in 1829 Lemnos became part of free Greece before being given back to Turkey in exchange for Euboea.  In 1912 the island was liberated by the Greek admiral, Koundouriotis.  The Gulf of Moudros was the base in 1914 for the disastrous Dardanelles expedition.  Under the terms of the Treaties of S\u00e8vres (1920) and of Lausanne (1923), Lemnos became an internationally recognised part of the Greek State.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q192483'>Wikidata ID: Q192483<\/a>","name":"Lemnos","modSource2":5,"placeID":"399253ILem","timePer":"","travelogues":10864,"pleiades":550693,"country":"Greece","region":"North Aegean","dept":"Limnos","2011LG":"Limnou","1997LG":"Atsikis","pre97":"Karpasiou","mod":"Lemnos","works":109,"regionKML":"3EMed","styleID":"Region2","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"orange","2014EPKA":"\u039b\u03ae\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2","concat1":"Lemnos (Aegean)","greek2":"\u039b\u1f75\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":2290442,"PHIsearch":"\u039b\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/550693","webPageData":41115,"work_id":2,"placeid":1982,"count":11}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[26.269999999999999573674358543939888477325439453125,39.91499999999999914734871708787977695465087890625]},"properties":{"pk":1984,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":179,"priority":3,"ModSource":12,"latitude":39.91499999999999914734871708787977695465087890625,"longitude":26.269999999999999573674358543939888477325439453125,"confidence":"High","description":"\u03a4\u03c1\u1ff3\u03ac\u03c2 - Troad, the region around ancient Troy (NW Turkey)","concat2":"Troad region (Asia Minor) 179 Canakkale - \u03a4\u03c1\u03c9\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2","featureTypes":"region\/people","icon":"region2.png","modernDescr":"<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2454671'>Wikidata ID: Q2454671<\/a>","name":"Troad","modSource2":12,"placeID":"399263RTro","timePer":"","travelogues":12980,"pleiades":550944,"country":"Turkey","region":"Asia Minor","dept":"","2011LG":"","1997LG":"","pre97":"","mod":"Canakkale","works":37,"regionKML":"3EMed","styleID":"Region2","dateRevised":20130000,"textColor":"orange","2014EPKA":"\u03a4\u03c1\u03c9\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2","concat1":"Troad region (Asia Minor)","greek2":"\u03a4\u03c1\u1ff3\u03ac\u03c2","iDAIGAZ":"","PHIsearch":"\u03a4\u03c1\u03c9\u03b1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/550944","webPageData":"","work_id":2,"placeid":1984,"count":6}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[26.23890000000000100044417195022106170654296875,39.95750000000000312638803734444081783294677734375]},"properties":{"pk":2006,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":2886,"priority":1,"ModSource":4,"latitude":39.95750000000000312638803734444081783294677734375,"longitude":26.23890000000000100044417195022106170654296875,"confidence":"High","description":"\u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd,\u03a4\u03c1\u03bf\u03af\u03b7 - Troy, Truva in the Troad in Turkey","concat2":"Troy\/Ilion (Troad) 2886 Truva - \u03a4\u03c1\u03bf\u03af\u03b7","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"polis.png","modernDescr":"Equidistant (about 5 km) from the Aegean and the Dardanelles. A gap of 400 years separates Troy VIIb, the final phase of the Bronze Age citadel, from the beginning of Troy VIII, when the site was reoccupied, apparently by Greek settlers, traditionally described as Aitolian, shortly before 700 B.C. To judge from the archaeological remains, Troy enjoyed a moderately active existence in the 7th and 6th c., and declined into comparative stagnation in the 5th and 4th c. In Hellenistic-Roman times (Troy IX) its fortunes were livelier. The town benefited substantially from the favor of Alexander and Lysimachos, and later from that of Caesar and Augustus, to say nothing of subsequent emperors, but there were also reverses, notably during the Mithridatic war, when Troy was captured and sacked by the Roman legate Fimbria in 85 B.C. Before deciding to locate his new capital on the Bosphoros, Constantine considered Troy as a possible site. The latest known Classical reference to the town is an account of a visit by the emperor Julian in A.D. 355. <br>The physical remains of Troy VIII are meager. The buildings of this period which originally occupied the hilltop were largely destroyed in Troy IX when the central part of the hill was leveled to provide a precinct for the cult of Athena Ilias. Though Troy VIII extended beyond the limits of the Bronze Age citadel, its people, for a time at least, relied for defense on the great wall of Troy VI, which they repaired and strengthened at vanous places. In the NE sector a wall was built to enclose a flight of steps that gave access to a well outside. At the SW, again outside the circuit of the VI wall, two sanctuaries of modest size lie adjacent to each other. They were founded in the mid 7th c., and continued into Troy IX. <br>Though Troy IX was larger and more prosperous, its remains are scarcely abundant. The plan of the great Sanctuary of Athena, which included a propylon and colonnades, has been determined, occupying an area almost half as large as all of Troy VI. Scattered fragments of a Doric temple have been recovered. The best preserved metope depicts Helios driving his chariot. Though its date is disputed, the temple is probably Early Hellenistic; its construction is ascribed by Strabo (13.1.26) to Lysimachos.

According to Strabo (590-91) it was occupied after the Trojan War by Thracians, until it was settled by Milesians with the consent of Gyges king of Lydia ca. 700 B.C. Burnt by Darios in 512, it formed one end of Xerxes' bridge across the Hellespont. In the Delian Confederacy it paid a tribute of four talents, but was always hostile to Athens (Dem., Aristocr. 158), and in 411 revolted from the confederacy and became a Spartan base. By the peace of Antalkidas it passed to Persia until the arrival of Alexander in 334. In 200 Abydos was attacked by Philip V and taken after a desperate resistance (Polyb. 16.29-34). After the defeat of Philip the city was given freedom by Rome (Livy 33.30), and under the Empire became an important toll station. The abundant coinage extends from the early 5th c. B.C. to the mid 3d c. A.D. Abydos possessed gold mines at a spot called variously Astyra or Kremaste (Xen. 4.8.37), but these were near exhaustion in Strabo's time. <br>The site, first recognized in 1675, is on the bay S of Nagara Point; the acropolis hill is called Mal Tepe. This bay is out of the main current and by far the best natural harbor in the straits. The accounts of travelers down to 1830 speak of considerable remains of walls and buildings; later, however, little or nothing could be seen. In this century the area has been a prohibited zone, and for the present state of the site no information is available. (G. E.

Its rugged gorges and peaks, its trees, waters, winds and shores, are not overwhelming or unwelcoming, but they possess something of the primeval simplicity and the scale of epic.  Its forests are those evoked by Homer; its winds are those that propelled and tormented Odysseus; the view from the summit of Mount Saos is the view that Poseidon had of the battle of Troy. Few islands leave so deep and clear and sober an image in the mind as Samothrace.  It is perhaps no surprise therefore that an important and very ancient cult of un-nameable and mysterious \u2018Great Gods' should have evolved here on the slopes of Mount Saos.  It was for this that the island was famous in Antiquity.  The excavated remains of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods are unusual and little visited.  Few Greek sites raise so many important questions which yet remain unanswered.<br>Samothrace has always derived importance from its position as a strategic refuge and landmark on the busy and very ancient maritime trade routes of the Northern Aegean.  Inhabited since the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, it was first occupied by people of Thracian stock.  The non-Greek Thracian language and religion survived the arrival of Greek colonists around 700 BC and was used in cult ritual as late as the 1st century BC.  Archaeological evidence contradicts the Classical tradition that the colonists came from Samos before that date; Strabo suggests that the Samians invented the story for their own glory.  The colonists' language has been shown by inscriptions to have been Aeolian rather than Ionian, and probably derived from Lesbos or the Troad.  Homer appears familiar with the island, and in the Iliad (XIII, 12) envisages Poseidon watching the fighting on the plains of Troy from the \u2018topmost peak of forested Samothrace'.  A legend relates that Troy was supposedly founded from the island, though it now seems more likely that it was from Lemnos.  <br>In the 6th century BC Samothrace had a silver coinage, the city reached its greatest extent and colonies were established on the mainland opposite.  The Samothracian navy was represented at the Battle of Salamis, fighting on the Persian side.  In the 5th century BC the island's power declined, though the fame of its cult increased until the island became the chief centre of religious life in the North Aegean.  Herodotus and Lysander of Sparta were initiated at the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, and Aristophanes and Plato refer to its \u2018Mysteries'.  Philip of Macedon met and fell in love with his wife Olympias of Epirus, mother of Alexander the Great, at the sanctuary. The island was formally incorporated into the Macedonian kingdom in 340 BC, and the dynasty continued to adorn the sanctuary until their downfall.  Samothrace was used as a naval base by the Second Athenian League, by King Lysimachos of Thrace and by the Ptolemies, Seleucids and Macedonians in turn.  After the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC, Perseus, the last king of Macedon sought refuge on the island only to be taken prisoner by the Romans.  Aristarchus, commentator and editor of Homer, and head of the Library of Alexandria around 153 BC, was from Samothrace. <br>The belief that Dardanos, the legendary founder of Troy, had come from Samothrace and that his descendant, Aeneas, had brought its cults to Rome gave the island a particular interest to the Romans.    In 84 BC the sanctuary was pillaged by corsairs, but soon revived under Roman patronage.  Varro and the statesman and collector, Lucius Calpurnius Piso (father-in-law to Julius Caesar), were initiates.  St. Paul appears to have stopped on the island on his way to Neapolis (Kavala) and Philippi (Acts 16.11) in 49\/50 AD.  Hadrian also visited Samothrace in 123 AD.   A severe earthquake in c. 200 AD began the sanctuary's decline, although the ancient religion survived remarkably into the 4th century.   <br>In 1431 the island was ceded by John VIII of Byzantium to Palamedes Gattilusi of Genoa, whose descendants styled themselves \u2018Princes of Ainos and Samothrace'.  In 1419 the island was visited by Cristoforo Buondelmonte, and in 1444 by Cyriac of Ancona who has left posterity a couple of valuable sketches from his visit.  Samothrace was taken by the Turks in 1457 who moved the inhabitants to Istanbul, and it remained an Ottoman possession (with the exception of brief occupations by the Venetians between 1466-70 and by the Russians between 1770-4), until it was liberated by the Greek fleet under Admiral Koundouriotis in 1912.  <br>The discovery of the \u2018Victory of Samothrace' by the French Consul, Champoiseau, in 1863 reignited scholarly interest in the island and pulled it back from obscurity.  The Sanctuary of the Great Gods was partially examined by French and Austrian archaeologists in the 1860s and 70s respectively; but the systematic uncovering of the site has mostly been the work of an American expedition (organised from New York University) which began its work in 1938 and has excavated continuously since then, with only a brief interruption during the Second World War, when the island was under a repressive Bulgarian occupation.  The island received a large \u00e9migr\u00e9 influx from Asia Minor between the wars: the population has fallen to 2,700 today from a recorded 4,258 in 1951. <br>Samothrace has no good, naturally sheltered, harbour anywhere on its perimeter; the few inlets offering refuge that were used in antiquity have since filled with sand and shingle.   Nor is sailing always easy in the vicinity of the island: the vast and impending mass of Mount Saos creates strange and unpredictable avalanches of wind that can tumble off the mountain at any time of day or season, throwing the waters around the island into confusion.  Homer placed Poseidon, alone on this summit, watching the events of the Trojan War unfold; his presence here is still felt in the capricious phenomena of the sea and the winds.  <br>Ancient Samothrace and the Gattilusi Towers: Of the ancient settlement and city of Samothrace, which lay on the ridge of the mountain to the east of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, only the walls remain today above ground.  The walls constitute an enceinte of 2,400 metres \u2013 almost two thirds complete \u2013 which can be seen climbing up the ridge to the east to a look-out post at a height of 275m a.s.l., after which they drop steeply down the eastern side of the ridge, traceable only at intermittent points.  Originally constructed in the 6th century BC, they have been repeatedly repaired, with a number of the corners and bastions clearly reinforced around the 3rd century BC.  They are similar in construction to sectors of the walls of Thasos, with two parallel curtain walls in-filled with rubble.  Five gates are still identifiable, the most interesting being just to the right of the main pathway \u2013 combining a curiously protruding protective bastion in its structure.  The city is known to have had an important sanctuary of Athena, but this has not yet been located, though archaeological soundings have concentrated in their search for it  at the eastern extremity of the area near the ruins of the church of Aghios Giorgios.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38283593'>Wikidata ID: Q38283593<\/a>","name":"Samothrake","modSource2":5,"placeID":"405255PSam","timePer":"ACHRLM","travelogues":12474,"pleiades":501596,"country":"Greece","region":"Thrace","dept":"Evros-Samothrace","2011LG":"Samothrakis","1997LG":"Samothrakis","pre97":"Samothrakis","mod":"Paleopolis","works":68,"regionKML":"Thrace3","styleID":"PolisHigh","dateRevised":20140818,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a3\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b7","concat1":"Samothrake (Samothrace)","greek2":"\u03a3\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03c1\u1fb4\u03ba\u03b7","iDAIGAZ":2362409,"PHIsearch":"\u03a3\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03c1","source":"http:\/\/pleiades.stoa.org\/places\/501596","webPageData":22854,"work_id":2,"placeid":2160,"count":1}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[26.081199999999999050714905024506151676177978515625,40.7237999999999971123543218709528446197509765625]},"properties":{"pk":2226,"Z_ENT":"","Z":"","hits":100,"priority":3,"ModSource":1,"latitude":40.7237999999999971123543218709528446197509765625,"longitude":26.081199999999999050714905024506151676177978515625,"confidence":"High","description":"\u0391\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 - Ainos, Classical to Medieval port city by Hebros river, acropolis at Enez castle, Turkey","concat2":"Ainos (Thrace) 100 Enez - \u0391\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2","featureTypes":"polity","icon":"polis.png","modernDescr":"Mentioned in the Iliad.

It is reachable by taking the cement road uphill from the iconostasio in mid-village, then following a clear path that runs up beside a streamlet and turns to reach the saddle from which the remains are accessible. Stretches of fortification wall, a few building traces, rooftiles, black-painted pottery. Dr. Joachim Heiden speculates that this site might be Pteleon, because he places Typaneai at Platiana. Pritchett (SAGT) believes this site to be Typaneai: \"In his Neue Pelop. Wander. (Bern 1957) 55-59, Meyer writes that in 1954 he came upon the site, which lies ten minutes east of the village of Vresto, as it is spelled today. It apparently escaped the notice of all the travellers, including Leake, Gell, Dodwell, Boutan, Curtius, Philippson, Frazer, et al., as well as the survey teams of more recent times. Meyer's description of the remains is the only publication of the site to date. He refers to it as the \u201cbedeutendste Ruine der ganzen Landschaft,\u201d and his pl. 68 seems to confirm this, although Platiana and Alipheira are in the neighborhood. The north-south axis of the enceinte is given as about 500 meters, the east-west as about 200 m. The enclosed area with a great number of ancient houses and terraced walls is saturated with sherds \u201cvon archaischer Zeit bis in die Kaiserzeit.\u201d He notes that the site is older than that of Platiana. The walls are \u201cin polygonaler Technik,\u201d and Meyer offers two photographs of towers. He adds (p.55) that the town was on the chief mountain-crossing from Lepreon and Phigaleia on one side and Platiana and Alipheira on the other. He offers no sketch, but publishes two inscriptions (= J. and L. Robert, REG 71 [1958] 249; SEG 16.281-282). If we ask why the impressive ruins were so long undiscovered, the answer probably lies in its inaccessibility. As recently as 1973, the guidebook, Akhaia and Ilia, published by the National Bank of Greece, said (p.46) that it could be reached only by \u201ca difficult road\u201d of eleven kilometers leading off from the Andritsaina highway at a tum-off called Tou Korba to Khani. It is noteworthy that A. Bon in his chapter titled \u201cLa Skorta\u201d (pp.363-406) gives indications of having visited all the other sites inspected by Meyer, but does not mention Gardiki (or Vresto). The term \u201cSkorta,\u201d Bon (pp.363-365) explains, was a word applied in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries to the mountainous district south of the Alpheios between the Coastal plain and the interior basin of Megalopolis-Mantineia, which was dominated by the Franks, who constructed numerous chateaux in this difficult terrain to protect themselves against the Greeks. We followed the instructions in the 1973 guidebook, turning off from the Andritsaina-Krestena highway to go through a large earthquake resettlement village of Amygdalies, by-passing Myronia, to arrive at Vresto. On retuming to the site in 1987, we took an easier road, recently bulldozed, taking off from the coastal highway near Zacharo through the villages of Arene, Milea, and Trypes(renamed Chrysochori).\" Pritchett SAGT Vol 6, pp53-54<br><a href='https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16622926'>Wikidata ID: Q16622926<\/a>","name":"Pteleon?","modSource2":6,"placeID":"375218UPte","timePer":"CHR","travelogues":"","pleiades":573486,"country":"Greece","region":"Peloponnese","dept":"Ileia","2011LG":"Andritsainas","1997LG":"Alipheiras","pre97":"Vrestou","mod":"Vresto","works":4,"regionKML":"PelopNW4","styleID":"Fort","dateRevised":20190410,"textColor":"yellow","2014EPKA":"\u03a0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cc\u03bd","concat1":"Pteleon?
